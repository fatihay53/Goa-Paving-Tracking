    "talk": "Anchor systems are a critical part of the personal fall arrest system. Anchor systems may be permanent or temporary. A worker at risk of falling certain distances (see Guardrails ) must be protected by guardrails or, if guardrails are not practical, by a travel-restraint system, fall-restricting system, fall-arrest system, or safety net. This document covers anchor systems. Other than guardrails and safety nets, all other means of fall protection require anchors (e.g., travel restraint, fall restrict, fall arrest). The fall protection equipment document covers the components of a fall protection system. If your workplace uses fall protection systems, please also see the documents on fall arrest planning and personal fall protection systems . The Construction Projects regulations outlines the two basic types of anchor systems for fall protection. Permanent anchor systems must be used as the fixed support in a fall arrest system, fall- restricting system, or travel restraint systems if the following conditions are met: It has been installed according to the Building Code . It is safe and practical to use the anchor system as the fixed support. If these two conditions are not met, a temporary fixed system must be used. The temporary fixed system must meet the following requirements: A support used in a fall arrest system must be capable of supporting a static force of at least 8 kilonewtons (1,800 pounds) without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used. If a shock absorber or other support is used, the support must be capable of supporting at least 6 kilonewtons (1,350 pounds) of static force without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used. Other supports may also be used as long as they are used according to the manufacturer’s written instructions and the support is adequate to protect a worker. A support when used with a travel-restraint system must support at least 2 kilonewtons (450 pounds) of static force without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used. Despite the above listed requirements, capacity of a temporary fixed support may be determined by dynamic testing according to good engineering practice which ensures the temporary fixed support is able to arrest a worker’s fall. A fixed support must not have any sharp edges that could cut, chafe, or abrade fall protection components. For temporary fixed supports, it is always recommended that a safety factor of 2 be applied to the weight requirements above."

    "talk": "Asbestos was one of the first designated substances to be regulated in Ontario. It is governed by Regulation 278 – Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations. The regulation specifies methods and procedures for working with or around asbestos-containing materials. “Asbestos-containing material” (ACM) means material that contains 0.5 per cent or more asbestos by dry weight. The Regulation defines asbestos as any of six fibrous silicates as: Actinolite. Amosite. Anthophyllite. Chrysotile. Crocidolite. Tremolite. The Regulation applies to: every project and its owner every constructor, employer and worker engaged in or on the project the repair, alteration or maintenance of a building every employer and worker involved in the repair, alteration or maintenance of the building and the owner of the building every building in which material that may be asbestos containing material (ACM) has been used and the owner of the building the repair, alteration, or maintenance of machinery, equipment, aircraft, ships, locomotives, railway cars and vehicles and work on a building that is necessarily incidental to the repair, alteration or maintenance of machinery or equipment where it is likely that ACM may be handled, dealt with, removed or disturbed, and every employer and worker engaged in this work to which the requirements for asbestos under Ontario Regulation 490/09 do not apply the demolition of machinery, equipment, aircraft, ships, locomotives, railway cars and vehicles, and every employer and every worker engaged in the demolition. These people include contractors and subcontractors who perform work for or supply services to the employer. Note: An owner is defined in the Act and includes a trustee, receiver, mortgagee in possession, tenant, lessee, or occupier of any lands or premises used or to be used as a workplace, as well as a person who acts for or on behalf of an owner as an agent or delegate. The Regulation does not apply: to the owner of a private home that is occupied by the owner or the owner's family to the owner of a residential building that contains no more than four units, one of which is occupied by the registered owner or family of the registered owner However, the Regulation does apply to constructors, employers and workers engaged in private construction projects and repair or maintenance of such buildings. Establishing Whether Material is Asbestos-Containing The Regulation requires that U.S. EPA Test Method EPA/600/R-93/116 be used to determine: whether a material is ACM, the type of asbestos in the material, and the content of asbestos in the material. The sample must be randomly collected by a competent worker and representative of each area of homogeneous material. The minimum number of bulk samples required is established in Table1 of the regulation and if analysis establishes the material contains 0.5% or more asbestos by dry weight the entire area of homogeneous material is deemed to be asbestos-containing material. Restrictions on sprayed material, insulation, sealants Material that contains 0.1% or more asbestos by dry weight must not be applied by spraying or as thermal insulation if it can become friable. Liquid sealants cannot be applied to friable asbestos-containing material if the material is deteriorated or the material is insufficient to support the weight of the sealant. Information for Workers A worker must be informed about The location of all ACM. For each location, whether the material is friable or non-friable. For sprayed-on friable material, for each location, the type of asbestos or whether the material will be treated as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. The requirement to inform workers applies if the work involves ACM, is being treated as ACM, or is close proximity to the material and may disturb it. Demolition Demolition may only be carried out or continued when any ACM that may be disturbed has been removed to the extent practicable. This requirement does not apply to situations where demolition is required in order to gain access to the ACM that must be removed, in which case workers must be protected. Ongoing asbestos management in buildings This section applies if: The owner treats material as if it were asbestos-containing material. The owner has been advised of the discovery of material that may be ACM. The owner knows or ought reasonably to know that ACM has been used in the building. ACM has been confirmed by examination or by the owner who has had an examination of the material carried out. The owner shall: prepare and keep on the premises a record containing: the location of all ACM, whether the material is friable or non-friable, for sprayed-on material, if the material is known to be ACM, its type or a statement that the material will be treated as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. The record must be updated every 12-months and whenever the owner becomes aware of new information relating to the record. Give an occupier of the building notice in writing of information contained in the record. The owner must provide information contained in the report to an employer contracted by the owner’s employers notice in writing of information contained in the record if their work may disturb the material. Inspect the material at reasonable intervals to determine its condition. The owner must establish and maintain for his/her workers a training and instruction program dealing with asbestos hazards personal protective equipment (use, care and disposal) personal hygiene measures and procedures prescribed by the Regulation, and Subsection 8(8) requires that even where no work is being done to a building, if friable material used as fireproofing or acoustical or thermal insulation has fallen and is being disturbed, all work involving the material must cease and the owner must have the material examined as set out in section 3 in order to determine whether it is ACM. Examination is not required unless it is treated as ACM and in the case of sprayed-on material as a type other than chrysotile. If the material is ACM or treated as though it were, the owner shall have the material cleaned up and removed. If the material will continue to fall due to its deterioration the fireproofing or insulation must be repaired, sealed, removed or permanently enclosed by the owner. Employer Responsibility An employer shall advise the owner of a building if the employer’s workers discover material that may be ACM. Owner’s responsibilities before requesting tender or arranging work Before an owner requests tenders or arranges for demolition, alteration, or repair, the owner must have a report prepared stating whether any material that may be handled, dealt with, disturbed or removed is or is not ACM . This requirement applies whether the material is friable or non-friable. An examination of the material is required to determine if it is ACM or not unless the owner Knows the material is not ACM, or Knows the material is ACM and in the case of sprayed-on material the type, or The work is to be carried out as though it were ACM and in the case of sprayed-on material treated as though it were a type other than chrysotile. The owner shall prepare a report that identifies Whether the material is or is not ACM, or if the work is to be performed as though the material were ACM and in the case of sprayed-on friable material as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. The material condition and whether it’s friable or non-friable, and Drawings, plans and specifications to show the location of the material. The owner shall give prospective constructors a copy of the report. A constructor must provide the report to prospective contractors. A contractor must provide the report to prospective subcontractors.   Discovery of ACM during Work If material is discovered during work that was not referred to in the owner’s report and may be ACM, the constructor and employer shall immediately notify, orally and in writing, the Ministry of Labour, the owner, the contractor and the joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative for the workplace. The notice must include the: name and address of the person giving the notice, name and address of the owner, municipal address or description of where the work will be carried out, description of the work, starting date and duration, and name and address of the supervisor. Work with the material shall stop until it has been determined whether it is ACM or not or as though the material were ACM and in the case of sprayed-on friable material as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. Notice of Type 3 and certain Type 2 Operations Before beginning a Type 3 operation, or removal of more than one square meter of insulation using a glove bag (Type 2), the constructor or employer shall notify, orally and in writing, the Ministry of Labour. The notice shall include: name and address of the person giving the notice, name and address of the owner, municipal address or description of where the work will be carried out, description of the work, starting date and duration, and name and address of the supervisor. Classifications of Work The regulation sets out three classifications of work which determine the measures and procedures, notification requirements, record keeping, medical surveillance and training and certification requirements for workers. In most cases, the constructor or employer in consultation with an appropriately qualified consultant determines the classification of work. Type 1 Operations Type 1 operations present the lowest exposure risk, generally including the installation or removal of ACM products that are non-friable, that is, material that is not easily crumbled between the thumb and the fingers, or is not already crumbled. The work must be done without damaging the material, or where the material will be damaged, the spread of fibres must be controlled by wetting the material and using non-powered handheld tools. Type 1 operations include: installation or removal of ACM ceiling tiles (less than 7.5 m2) without damage installation or removal of non-friable ACM , other than ceiling tiles, without damage breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable ACM that is wetted and where the work is done using non-powered hand-held tools, and removal of less than one square metre of drywall where ACM joint-filling compounds were used. “Damage” includes breakage, cutting, abrading, grounding, sanding, and vibration. Type 2 Operations The following types of operations are classified as Type 2 operations: the removal of all or part of a false ceiling to access a work area, if ACM is likely to be lying on the surface of the false ceiling enclosure of friable ACM application of tape, a sealant or other covering to pipe or boiler insulation that is ACM installing or removing ACM ceiling tiles that cover an area of 7.5 m2 or more if the work is done without damaging the tiles the removal or disturbance of one square metre or less of friable asbestos-containing material during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of machinery or equipment or a building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car, vehicle or ship breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding, or vibrating non-friable ACM using non-powered hand-held tools if the material is not wetted cleaning or removing filters used in air handling equipment in a building that has sprayed ACM fireproofing removal or disturbance of one square metre or less of friable ACM during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of machinery or equipment or a building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car glove bag removals of ACM insulation breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable asbestos-containing material if the work is done by means of power tools that are attached to dust-collecting devices equipped with High Efficiency Particulate Aerosol (HEPA) filters removing insulation that is asbestos-containing material from a pipe, duct or similar structure using a glove bag, or an operation that may expose a worker to ACM and is not classified as Type 1 or 2. Type 3 Operations Work with friable or non-friable ACM that has the potential to generate high concentrations of asbestos fibres in air is classified as Type 3. Type 3 operations include: removal or disturbance of more than one square metre of friable ACM spray application of a sealant to friable ACM cleaning or removal of air-handling equipment, including rigid ducting but not including filters, in a building that has sprayed ACM fireproofing repair, alteration or demolition of a kiln or furnace made, in part, of refractory materials that are ACM breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable ACM with power tools not attached to dust-collecting devices with HEPA filters, and repair, alteration or demolition of a building in which asbestos products were manufactured, unless the asbestos was cleaned up and removed before March 16, 1986. When working with friable ACM, drywall or ceiling tiles, the type of operation is based on the total area on which work is done consecutively in a room or enclosed area even if work is divided into smaller jobs. The Ministry of Labour must be notified if there is a dispute about the classification of an operation. Work on the operation must be stopped until the Ministry of Labour has provided its decision in writing. Respirators A respirator assigned to a worker must: be for his/her exclusive use must be fit-tested unless it is equipped with a hood or helmet be used and maintained according to the employer’s written procedures be cleaned, disinfected and inspected after each use have damaged or deteriorated parts replaced be stored in a convenient, clean and sanitary location. For suppled-air respirators: Compressed air used for breathing must meet the standards set ou tin Table 1 of CSA Z180.1-00 – Compressed Breathing Air and System (2000). If an oil-lubricated compressor is used to supply air, a continuous carbon monoxide monitor with alarm must be provided. For ambient breathing air systems, the air intake must be located in accordance with Appendix B of CSA Z180.1-00 – Compressed Breathing Air and System (2000). When respirators are used at work, the employer must establish written procedures for the selection, care and use of the respirators and those procedures must be reviewed by each worker required to wear a respirator. A worker who is required to wear a respirator must be physically able to perform the work while using the respirator. The following measures and procedures apply to Type 1 Operations Remove visible dust from surfaces with a damp cloth or HEPA vacuum. Use drop sheets of polyethylene or other impervious materials. Drywall containing less than 1 square meter of asbestos-containing joint compound must be wetted before and during the work. A wetting agent must be added to water used to control the spread of dust. Frequently, at regular intervals, and immediately upon completing work, dust and waste must be cleaned up, removed using a HEPA vacuum or by damp mopping or wet sweeting. Dust, waste and drop sheets must be placed in a container that meets this regulation. Drop sheets and Polyethylene sheeting used for barriers and enclosures shall be wetted and appropriately discarded and not be reused unless they are rigid and can be thoroughly cleaned. Compressed air must not be used to clean up dusts. Eating, drinking, chewing or smoking shall not be permitted in the work area. Although respiratory protection is not required for Type 1 operations, a worker may request one and the employer must provide it. The respirator must be NIOSH approved and selected in accordance with Table 2 of this regulation. The worker must wear and use the respirator. Although protective clothing is not required for Type 1 operations, a worker may request it and the employer must provide it. The clothing and it must be selected in accordance with this regulation. The worker must wear the protective clothing. Before leaving the work area the worker must decontaminate the protective clothing using a HEPA vacuum or damp wiping before removing the protective clothing, or place it in an appropriate waste container. Facilities must be available for workers to wash hands and face before leaving the work area. The following measures and procedures apply to Type 2 and 3 Operations A sufficient number of warning signs must be posted in the work area to warn about of the hazards. The signs must read “There is an asbestos dust hazard and access to the work area is restricted to personal wearing protective clothing and equipment”. A wetting agent must be added to water and used to control the spread of dust. Eating, drinking, chewing or smoking shall not be permitted in the work area. Use dust-tight, impervious waste containers suitable for the waste. The container must be identified and cleaned with a damp cloth or HEPA vacuum before being removed from the work area Dust and waste shall be cleaned up and removed using a HEPA vacuum or by damp mopping or wet sweeping and placed in a suitable waste container. Drop sheets shall not be reused. Polyethylene sheeting and similar material must not be reused. They must be wetted and placed in an appropriate waste container. Barriers and portable enclosures must be rigid. If they are to be reused they shall be cleaned by HEPA vacuum or by damp wiping. Every worker who enters the work area must be provided with a NIOSH approved respirator in accordance with Table 2 of this regulation. The employer must also ensure protective clothing is provided to workers that is impermeable to asbestos fibres, consists of a head and full body covering fitting snugly at the ankles, wrists and neck, and that suitable footwear is worn. If protective clothing is torn it shall be repaired or replaced. Compressed air is not permitted for cleaning dust from surfaces. Only persons wearing protective clothing and equipment shall enter the work area. Additional measures and procedures for Type 2 Operations A HEPA vacuum must be used to clean up any ACM that may be lying on the surface of a false ceiling when removing all or part of it for access. Damp wiping or a HEPA vacuum must be used to clean up friable material that is crumbled, pulverized or powdered and is lying on any surface before it is disturbed. Friable ACM that is not crumbled, pulverized or powdered and may be disturbed or removed during the work must be wetted before the work begins and throughout. Polyethylene drop sheets or other suitable materials must be used to prevent the spread of dust. For the following two operations if carried on indoors: removing all or part of a false ceiling to obtain access to a work area, if asbestos-containing material is likely to be lying on the surface of the false ceiling, or the removal or disturbance of one square metre or less of friable asbestos-containing material during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of machinery or equipment or a building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car, vehicle or ship. The spread of dust shall be prevented by using an enclosure of polyethylene or other suitable material that is impervious to asbestos (including, if the enclosure is opaque, one or more transparent window areas to allow observation of the entire work area from outside the enclosure), if the work area is not enclosed by walls, disabling the mechanical ventilation system serving the work area, and sealing the ventilation ducts to and from the work area. Before leaving the work area, workers must decontaminate using a HEPA vacuum or damp wiping. Facilities must be available for workers to wash hands and face before leaving the work area. For glove bag operations the following procedures apply in addition to the procedures required for Type 2 Walls, barricades, fencing or other suitable means shall be used to separate the work area from the rest of the workplace. The mechanical ventilation system serving the work area shall be disabled and all openings or voids including ducts must be sealed. Drop sheets made of polyethylene or other impervious material are to be placed under the work area. The glove bag must be made of strong and impervious material and equipped with: sleeves and gloves that are permanently sealed to the body of the bag valves or openings to allow insertion of a vacuum hose and the nozzle of a water sprayer a tool pouch with a drain a seamless bottom and a means of sealing off the lower portion of the bag, and a high strength double throw zipper and removable straps, if the bag is to be moved during the removal operation. A glove bag must have a proper seal otherwise it cannot be used. The glove bag must be inspected before it is attached to insulation jacketing or coating. The glove bag must be inspected before it is attached to pipe, duct or other similar structure and at regular intervals and shall not be used if defects are detected. The contents of the glove bag must be wetted and the disposed of along with the glove bag in an appropriate container. The work area shall be cleaned by HEPA vacuum before removal work is resumed. The air inside the bag shall be removed through an elasticized valve, by means of a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter. The pipe, duct or similar structure shall be wiped down and sealed with a suitable encapsulant and the glove bag, with the waste inside, shall be placed in an appropriate waste container. The work area shall be cleaned by damp wiping or by HEPA vacuum. Additional Measures and Procedures for Type 3 Operations The work area shall be separated from the rest of the workplace by walls, the placing of barricades or fencing or other suitable means. The following procedures apply to Type 3 operations involving breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable asbestos-containing material, if the work is done by means of power tools that are not attached to dust-collecting devices equipped with HEPA filters. Polyethylene enclosures or other suitable impervious materials must be used if the work area is not enclosed by walls. The enclosure must also include one or more transparent windows to allow observation from outside the enclosure. A curtain made from polyethylene or other suitable impervious material must be installed at each entrance or exit from the work area. Excluding outdoor operations or work in buildings to be demolished, a ventilation system equipped with a HEPA filtered exhaust unit must be used to create and maintain a negative air pressure of 0.02 inches of water within the enclosed area relative to the area outside of the enclosure. The air pressure must be measured at regular intervals. The air intake must be taken from an area free from contamination of any hazardous dusts, vapours, smoke, fume, mist or gas. A competent person must inspect and maintain the ventilation system. The inspection is required before each use and damaged or defective parts replaced before the ventilation system is used. Before leaving the work area, workers must decontaminate using a HEPA vacuum or damp wiping. Facilities for the washing of hands and face shall be made available to workers and shall be used by every worker when leaving the work area. The following procedures apply to Type 3 operations carried on outdoors involving the following activities: The removal or disturbance of more than one square metre of friable asbestos-containing material during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of a building, aircraft, ship, locomotive, railway car or vehicle or any machinery or equipment. The spray application of a sealant to friable asbestos-containing material. Cleaning or removing air handling equipment, including rigid ducting but not including filters, in a building that has sprayed fireproofing that is asbestos-containing material. Repairing, altering or demolishing all or part of a kiln, metallurgical furnace or similar structure that is made in part of refractory materials that are asbestos-containing materials. When performing work: ACM must be thoroughly wetted before and during removal unless it is hazardous to do so. Dust and waste shall not be permitted to fall freely from one work level to another. After the work area has been cleaned up using the HEPA vacuum or by damp mopping or wet sweeping, the work area must be washed down with water. Temporary electrical power for tools and equipment in wet removal operations shall be equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters. The decontamination facility shall be located as close as practicable to the work area and shall consist of a room suitable for changing into protective clothing and for storing contaminated protective clothing and equipment, a shower room as described by this regulation, and a room suitable for changing into street clothes and for storing clean clothing and equipment.

Repairing, altering or demolishing all or part of any building in which asbestos is or was used in the manufacture of products, unless the asbestos was cleaned up and removed before March 16, 1986. Be aware that: Friable asbestos-containing material that is lying on any surface shall be cleaned up and removed using a HEPA vacuum or by damp wiping. Everything shall be removed from the work area or covered with polyethylene sheeting or other suitable impervious material. A polyethylene enclosure or other suitable impervious material that is impervious to asbestos if the work area is not enclosed by walls. A decontamination facility is required and must consist of a series of interconnecting rooms including: a room for changing into and storing protective clothing a shower room as described by this regulation, a room for changing into and storing street clothes and equipment, and curtains of polyethylene sheeting or other suitable material that is impervious to asbestos, fitted to each side of the entrance or exit to each room. The decontamination rooms shall be arranged so that any person entering or exiting the facility must pass through each room. The mechanical ventilation system serving the work area shall be disabled and all openings or voids, including ventilation ducts to or from the work area, shall be sealed by tape or other appropriate means. For operations carried on indoors where the building will not be demolished, a ventilation system equipped with a HEPA filtered exhaust unit must be used to create and maintain a negative air pressure of 0.02 inches of water within the enclosed area relative to the area outside of the enclosure. The air pressure must be measured at regular intervals. The air intake must be taken from an area free from contamination of any hazardous dusts, vapours, smoke, fume, mist or gas. A competent person must inspect and maintain the ventilation system. The inspection is required before each use and damaged or defective parts replaced before the ventilation system is used. The shower room in the decontamination facility must have cold and hot water whose temperature isn ot less than 40° Celsius or more than 50° Celsius. Controls must be available to regulate water flow and temperature. The shower room must also be equipped with clean towels When leaving the work area, a worker shall enter the decontamination facility and shall, in the following order: decontaminate his or her protective clothing by using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter, or by damp wiping, before removing the protective clothing, if the protective clothing will not be reused, place it in an appropriate waste container, shower, and remove and clean the respirator. If practicable, existing electrical power distribution systems that are not water-tight shall be de-energized and locked out where wet removal operations are to be carried out. Temporary electrical power for tools and equipment in wet removal operations shall be equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters. Friable asbestos-containing material shall be thoroughly wetted before and during removal if safe to do so. A competent worker must inspect the enclosures, barriers and decontamination facility at the start and end of each shift and at least once each day on days where there are no shifts. If defects are found, no work shall be carried out and the defect must be repaired immediately. If practicable, dust and waste shall be kept wet. When work is complete, negative air pressure must be maintained. The walls of the enclosure must be washed or HEPA vacuumed. Equipment and tools must be cleaned by damp cloth or HEPA vacuum or discarded in an appropriate waste container. A visual inspection must be carried out by a competent person to ensure the enclosure and work area are free from visible dust or debris. Once dried and clean clearance air testing must be carried out by a competent person unless the operation is carried out in a building to be demolished. The barriers, enclosure and decontamination facility shall not be removed or dismantled until cleaning has been done in accordance with this regulation and the work area inside the enclosure has passed the clearance air testing if it is required. Sample collection for clearance air testing shall be performed using the phase contrast microscopy method or transmission electron microscopy. If the clearance air test fails, the work area, inner surfaces of the enclosures, equipment, and tools shall be cleaned again in accordance with this regulation. A visual inspection must be carried out by a competent worker. Clearance air testing using the phase contrast microscopy method shall be carried out in accordance with U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods, Method 7400, Issue 2: Asbestos and other Fibres by PCM (August 15, 1994), using the asbestos fibre counting rules, and shall comply with the following requirements: Testing shall be based on samples taken inside the enclosure. Before and during air sampling, fibres shall be dislodged inside the enclosure using forced air. At least 2,400 litres of air shall be drawn through each sample filter. The number of air samples to be collected shall be in accordance with Table 3 of this regulation. In order for the clearance air test to pass, every air sample has an airborne concentration that does not exceed 0.01 fibres per cubic centimeters of air. If the clearance air test fails using the phase contract microscopy method, the samples may be subjected to a second analysis using transmission electron microscopy in accordance with the standard mentioned in this regulation. When a second analysis is performed using transmission electron microscopy, the work area inside the enclosure passes the clearance air test only if every air sample collected has a concentration of asbestos fibres that does not exceed 0.01 fibres per cubic centimetre of air. Clearance air testing using the transmission electron microscopy method shall be carried out in accordance with U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods, Method 7402, Issue 2: Asbestos by TEM (August 15, 1994), and shall comply with the following requirements: Testing shall be based on samples taken inside the enclosure and samples taken outside the enclosure but inside the building. Before and during air sampling, fibres shall be dislodged inside the enclosure using forced air At least 2,400 litres of air shall be drawn through each sample filter. At least five air samples shall be taken inside each enclosure and at least five air samples shall be taken outside the enclosure but inside the building. Sampling inside and outside the enclosure shall be conducted concurrently. The work area inside the enclosure passes the clearance air test if the average concentration of asbestos fibres in the samples collected inside the enclosure is statistically less than the average concentration of asbestos fibres in the samples collected outside the enclosure, or if there is no statistical difference between the two average concentrations. Within 24 hours after the clearance air testing results are received, the owner and the employer shall post a copy of the results in a conspicuous place or places at the workplace, and if the building contains other workplaces, in a common area of the building. A copy shall be provided to the joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, if any, for the workplace and for the building. The owner of the building shall keep a copy of the clearance air testing results for at least one year after receiving them. Instruction and training The employer shall ensure that a competent person provides training and instruction to every worker in a Type 1, 2, or 3 Operation. The training must include: The hazards of asbestos exposure. Personal hygiene and work practices. The use, cleaning and disposal of respirators and protective clothing. The joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, if any, for the workplace shall be advised of the time and place where the instruction and training are to be carried out. Instruction and training related to respirators shall include the limitations of the respirator, inspection and maintenance, proper fitting and cleaning and disinfection. Asbestos Abatement Training Programs The employer shall ensure that any worker involved in Type 3 operations has completed the Asbestos Abatement Worker Training Program approved by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities and that every supervisor in a Type 3 operation has successfully completed the Asbestos Abatement Supervisor Training Program approved by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. Documentation provided by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities is conclusive proof that a worker and supervisor have successfully completed the program. . As determined by a Director of the Ministry of Labour, a worker may complete equivalent training in another province or territory of Canada and hold a document showing successful completion of the MTCU training. . Asbestos work report The employer of a worker in a Type 2 or Type 3 operation must complete an asbestos work report at least once every 12-months and immediately upon the termination of the worker’s employment. The asbestos work report must be sent to the Ministry of Labour Provincial Physician and a copy given to the worker. Asbestos Workers Register The Ministry of Labour Provincial Physician shall establish and maintain an Asbestos Workers Register listing the name of each worker for whom an employer submits an asbestos work report. A worker on the asbestos workers register may volunteer to undergo prescribed medical examinations on the recommendation of the Provincial Physician. The worker may volunteer to undergo subsequent examinations if recommended by his/her physician. A medical examination includes medical questionnaire, chest x-rays and pulmonary function tests. Subsequent examinations of the same type if recommended by the worker’s physician will occur at least two years thereafter. If a worker is removed from exposure to asbestos because an examination discloses he/she may have or has a condition resulting from exposure to asbestos, the worker is entitled to compensation for loss of earnings provided by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997. Use of equivalent measure or procedures A constructor or employer may vary a measure or procedure that is required by Regulation 278 if it affords protection that is at least equal to the measures and procedures in the regulation. The constructor or employer must give written notice to the Joint Health and Safety Committee or Health and Safety Representative.

    "header": "Carbon Monoxide",
    "talk": "Carbon monoxide (chemical abbreviation: CO) is a clear, colourless gas you can’t smell or taste. It’s dangerous because it interferes with your body’s ability to use oxygen. Even in small doses, carbon monoxide can kill you. The first signs are headache and fatigue. Higher exposure can rapidly lead to loss of consciousness, arrested breathing, heart failure, and death. On a construction project you may be exposed to carbon monoxide when working around equipment and tools such as propane heaters, circular saws, compressors, scissor lifts, cement mixers, and any gasoline-, propane, or diesel-powered equipment. Exposure can be more severe when in an enclosed or confined space. In general, every employer must take all reasonable measures necessary to protect workers from exposure to hazardous biological or chemical agents, including carbon monoxide. Measures of protection include: engineering controls, work practices, hygiene facilities and practices, and personal protective equipment. Internal combustion engines in excavations, in buildings, or other enclosed structure must have an adequate supply of air for combustion (except for those operating in a tunnel). Exhaust gases and fumes must be discharged directly outside to a point far enough away to prevent the return of the gases or fumes. Similarly, the space must have adequate natural or mechanical ventilation to discharge exhaust and fumes so that carbon monoxide does not return or build up to hazardous levels. Internal combustion engines must be maintained in good condition so the engine’s exhaust discharge of carbon monoxide is minimized. Before using an internal combustion engine in a tunnel, a Ministry of Labour Director must give approval. Excavations, buildings, or enclosed structures where fuel is burnt must be to be tested for airborne concentrations of carbon monoxide to ensure the concentrations are not hazardous. Testing must be done according to a written testing strategy developed in consultation with a health and safety representative or the joint health and safety committee, if any. Exposure to concentrations may not exceed the time-weighted average limit (TWA)or the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL). These limits are defined in Regulation 833 Control of Exposure to Biological or Chemical Agents, and can be found in the table entitled “Adopted Values” shown at pages 10 to 61 of the publication entitled 2013 Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices published by ACGIH and identified by International Standard Book Number 978-1-607260-59-2. Occupational Exposure Limits for Ontario Workplaces Agent [CAS No.] Time-Weighted Average Limit (TWA) Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) For any period of 30 minutes At any time Carbon monoxide [630-08-0] 25 parts per million (ppm) 75 ppm 125 ppm To determine if your workplace meets the allowable daily and weekly time-weighted average airborne concentrations of carbon monoxide, see Schedule 1 of Control of Exposure to Biological or Chemical Agents . When calculating these concentrations, any use of personal protective equipment, such as supplied air, does not alter the allowable limits of carbon monoxide to which a worker may be exposed."

    "talk": "Each year in Ontario, construction workers are injured while using chainsaws.Generally the injuries result from two types of accidents: the operator makes accidental contact with the revolving chain the operator is struck by the object being cut, usually a tree or heavy limb. Many of these injuries are serious or critical. While the chainsaw is relatively easy to operate, it can be lethal. As with all high-speed cutting tools, it demands the full attention of even the trained and experienced operator. Workers must be adequately trained before using chain-saws.When using chain-saws workers must wear adequate personal protective equipment including protective clothing, gloves as well as eye and hearing protection.   Chainsaws must be firmly held by both hands when cutting. Chainsaws used in construction must have “anti-kickback” chains also referred to as “safety chains”.  They must also be equipped with a chain brake to prevent the chain from moving when the chainsaw is not in use.  Every gear, pulley, belt, chain, shaft, flywheel, saw and other mechanically-operated part of a machine to which a worker has access shall be guarded or fenced so that it will not endanger a worker."

    "subject": "confined_space",
    "header": "Confined Space",
    "talk": "A confined space is defined as a place: that is partially or fully enclosed that is not both designed and constructed for continuous human occupancy, and where atmospheric hazards may occur because of its construction, location, or contents, or because of work that is done in it. Physical hazards found in a confined space often present a greater danger inside an enclosed space than they do outside. Confined Space Program The confined space program can apply to one or more confined spaces. Program elements must include: a method of recognizing each confined space a method for assessing the hazards to which workers may be exposed a method for developing plans for controlling the hazards a method for training workers an entry permit system setting out measures and procedures to be followed when working in a confined space. Employers must provide a copy of the program to the constructor of a project. In turn, the constructor must provide a copy of the program to the project's joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative, if any. A copy must also be available to other employers to which the program relates and every worker if there is no project joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. Before allowing any worker to enter a confined space, employers must develop a written confined space program. The employer must maintain the program. Before allowing a worker to enter a confined space, the employer must develop and maintain a written confined space program that meets the requirements of the Confined Spaces Regulation. In the case of a workplace that is not a project, a confined space program must be developed and maintained in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative. Employers must provide a copy of the program to the constructor of a project. In turn, the constructor must provide a copy of the program to the project's joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative, if any. A copy must also be available to other employers to which the program relates, and to every worker if there is no project joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. If workers from more than one employer will be entering the confined space, the constructor must prepare a confined space coordination program. A copy of the confined space coordination document must be provided to each employer who is performing work in the confined space and to the project's joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative. Coordination When workers of more than one employer perform work in the same confined space, the constructor must prepare a coordination document to ensure that the various employers perform their duties in a way that protects the health and safety of all workers. A copy of the coordination document must be provided to: each employer of workers who perform work in the same confined space the project's joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. If the workplace is not a project, the work detailed in the coordination document may assign this duty to one or more employers. Hazard Assessment Before each time that a worker enters a confined space, a person with adequate knowledge, training and experience must perform a written hazard assessment. The name of the competent worker must appear on the assessment, that person must give a copy to the employer, and the employer must keep a record of the competent worker's qualifications. The hazard assessment must take into account: the hazards that may exist in the confined space the hazards that may develop while work is performed inside the confined space general safety hazards in the confined space. An assessment is generally required for each confined space. But if there are two or more similar confined spaces containing the same hazards, then you need only a single assessment document but each confined space must be clearly identified and recorded. The record of an assessment may be incorporated into an entry permit under section 10. If requested, the employer must give copies of the assessment and the qualifications of the person with adequate knowledge, training and experience to the projectʼs joint health and safety committee, or the health and safety representative, or every worker involved in the confined space entry if the project has no joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. The employer must review the assessment as often as necessary to make sure that the plans remain adequate. Plan Once the hazards have been identified in the assessment, a competent person must develop a plan to eliminate the hazards or control the risks. The primary objective of the plan is to eliminate the hazard before entry. If this is not possible, then controls, measures, and procedures must be put in place to ensure that workers are not in danger. If confined spaces are of similar construction and present the same hazards, a single plan can be used as long as the individual confined spaces are clearly identified in both the hazard assessment and the plan. The plan must contain provisions for: Duties of workers Co-ordination document (prepared by the constructor) if workers of more than one contractor enter the same confined space On-site rescue procedures Rescue equipment and methods of communication Protective clothing and equipment Isolation of energy and control of material movement Attendants Adequate means of entry and exit (access and egress) Atmospheric testing (conducted by a competent worker) Adequate procedures for working in the presence of explosive or flammable substances Ventilation and purging Worker Training Workers entering a confined space must be trained by a competent person before they enter a confined space. The training must be developed in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or worker representative, and include: recognizing the hazards and potential hazards in the confined space, safe work practices, and the importance of following the confined space entry plan. General hazard identification training and plan specific training may be combined. You must review the content of the training at least annually, and whenever there is a change in circumstances such as a change in an industrial process. If the review indicates that the training is not adequate, you must provide additional training. You must keep a record of the names of trainers, trainees, as well as the date of training. If the project’s joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative wants a copy of the record, you must provide one. Entry Permits Employers must issue a separate entry permit each time work is to be performed in a confined space before any worker enters the confined space. Before each shift, a competent person must verify that the permit issued complies with the plan. Entry permits must be understood by everyone involved in the job and must be readily available to every person entering the confined space. Entry permits must include the location and description of the confined space a description of the work a description of the hazards and the corresponding controls the time period for which the entry permit applies the name of the attendant a record of each worker who enters and leaves a list of the equipment required for entry and rescue, and verification that the equipment is in good working order the results of the atmospheric testing additional procedures and control measures if hot work is to be done. On-site rescue procedures Adequate written on-site rescue procedures for each confined space must be developed and ready for immediate implementation. Before workers enter a confined space, employers must provide the necessary number of competent rescue personnel. Rescue personnel persons must be trained in: on-site rescue procedures first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation; and the use of the rescue equipment required by a relevant plan. Employers are responsible for making sure that identified rescue equipment must be: readily available, appropriate for entry into the confined space, inspected as often as is necessary, by a competent person designated by the employer, and a written record of these inspections must be kept by the employer or constructor. The employer must have methods of communication in place that are appropriate for the hazards identified in the assessment, and make these communication methods available to the workers and the attendant. Personal protective equipment, clothing and devices Employers must ensure workers in a confined space are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment, clothing and devices according to a relevant plan. Isolation of Energy and Control of Material Movement The following sources of energy must be controlled by taking the steps outlined, or if this method(s) is not practical, other satisfactory means may be used according to a relevant plan: Blanking or disconnecting piping can be used to protect against the release of hazardous substances. Electrical equipment in the confined space should be disconnected, tagged, locked out, and grounded when possible. Isolating equipment that moves in any way. This isolation can be achieved by disconnecting the equipment from its power source and de-energizing the equipment, or lockout and tagging, blocking or other means. Employers must also use measures to protect workers from drowning, engulfment, entrapment, suffocation and other hazards from free-flowing material. Attendants An attendant must be present whenever a worker enters a confined space. The attendant is not allowed to enter the confined space, unless he or she is replaced by another attendant according to the plan. The attendant must: be assigned, remain outside and near to the entrance (or the entrance that will best allow the attendant to perform their duties), be in constant communication (visual or speech) with all workers in the confined space, be provided with a device for summoning adequate rescue response in case of emergency, monitor the safety of workers inside the confined space, provide assistance as necessary, and summon adequate rescue procedure if required. The attendant is not allowed to enter the confined space to perform a rescue even after help has arrived unless he or she is replaced by another attendant in accordance with the plan. Entry and Exit (Access and Egress) Confined space entrances and exits must be provided to all workers and according with relevant plan. Entrances and exits must be secured so that only authorized workers can enter. There must be adequate barricades and warning signs. Atmospheric testing The employer must appoint a competent person to safely test the atmosphere in the confined space before and during the time a worker is there to ensure that acceptable atmospheric levels are maintained according to the relevant plan. If the confined space has been left unoccupied and unattended, you must perform the testing again. Testing instruments must be properly calibrated, maintained and be appropriate for the hazards in each specific confined space. Results of every sample of a test must be recorded on the entry permit. If continuous monitoring is performed, test results must be recorded at adequate intervals. Explosive and flammable substances The employer must make sure that elimination of hazards or control of risks from explosive and flammable substances is achieved by ventilation, purging or other means, according to the relevant plan. The employer must make sure that no worker enters or remains in a confined space that contains, or is likely to contain, an airborne combustible dust or mist whose atmospheric concentration may create a hazard of explosion. Generally, when there is an accumulation of flammable, combustible or explosive agents in a confined space, entry is allowed only if: the hazardous atmosphere is rendered inert by adding an inert gas and it can be continuously monitored to ensure it remains inert the workers use adequate respiratory protective equipment adequate rescue equipment is provided so that the person outside can locate and rescue the worker other equipment is provided as is necessary to ensure the worker’s safety. The following are the legislated exceptions: The inspection will not create a source of ignition. Atmospheric concentration of an explosive or flammable gas or vapour is less than 25% of its lower explosive limit (LEL), as determined by a combustible gas instrument. If cold work is being done, the concentration of flammable gas or vapour must be less than 10% of its LEL. If hot work is being done and all the following conditions are in place: the concentration of flammable or explosive gas less than 5% of its LEL, the oxygen content will likely remain less than 23%, the atmosphere is monitored continuously, an entry permit provides for control measures for hot work, and corresponding control measures, an adequate warning system and exit procedure are in place if explosive or flammable gas or vapour exceeds 5% of its LEL or oxygen content of the atmosphere exceeds 23 per cent by volume. Ventilation and purging Ventilation, purging or both may be required to ensure safe atmospheric conditions. If mechanical ventilation is used , an adequate warning system and exit procedure is required. If mechanical ventilation or purging is not practical: the workers must use adequate respiratory protective equipment adequate rescue equipment must be provided so that the person outside can locate and rescue the worker other equipment must be provided as is necessary to ensure the worker’s safety Recordkeeping The constructor for the project, and the employer for the workplace or project, as the case may be, must keep records of every: plan assessment coordination document training entry permit record of rescue equipment inspection record of tests All the above records must be kept for at least one year after the project is finished, or a period that is necessary to maintain at least the two of the most recent records of each kind concerning each particular confined space, whichever time period is longer. The records must be available for inspection. Records must be kept by those responsible for creating them. On a project, they may be kept by either the employer or the constructor."

    "subject": "Demolition",
    "header": "Demolition and Damaged Structures",
    "talk": "Demolition is the act of tearing down existing buildings and structures. It can be as simple as removing a portion of a house for a renovation project or as complex as demolishing a multi-storey building. Over the years, demolition work has evolved from a mainly manual process to a heavily mechanical one. Some tasks still have to be done manually and now the majority of loss time injuries in demolition are from musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Simple and practical work methods to reduce the risk of overexertion have helped to lower the injury rates in this sector. However workers are still exposed to a variety of other occupational hazards including falling structures and materials, dust, asbestos, lead, hazardous noise levels, and potential of falls from heights. Owners must determine if there is any asbestos that may be handled, disturbed or removed during the demolition or dismantling process. Please see Designated Substance -- Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations, O. Reg 278/05 to get a full description of the legal duties concerning working safely near asbestos. Owners must supply the demolition contractors with a designated substance report as well. The Occupational Health and Safety Act states that: Duty of project owners 30. (1) Before beginning a project, the owner shall determine whether any designated substances are present at the project site and shall prepare a list of all designated substances that are present at the site. It is a good idea to not only provide a list but to locate to the demolition contractor where the designated substances are located. Remember there may also be local by-laws regulating demolition projects as well as other provincial regulations such as environmental rules that must be followed. When a structure is so damaged that it becomes and hazard and endangers workers because of the potential for a partial or complete collapse, it must be braced and shored. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to prevent injuries of those near damaged structures or the demolition site. Progressively install safeguards from the safest areas towards the damaged structure, so that workers establishing the safeguards are not endangered. Only workers who are working on the demolition, dismantling or moving of a structure can be in, on or near that structure. There must be barriers to prevent people from coming near or inside the remaining parts of a structure when the demotion or dismantling is stopped. Workers can only enter such a structure if it can support the worker and will not collapse. Before demolition, dismantling or moving of a structure, appropriate safeguards must be in place so that people on or near the demolition site are not injured, all gas, electrical and other services must be shut off or disconnected and remain so if they could endanger workers and other people, and toxic, flammable or explosive substances must be removed. Demolishing and dismantling of a building or structure The listed rules below do NOT apply when any of the following are being used in the demolition process, a heavy weight suspended by cable from a crane or similar hoisting device, a power shovel, bulldozer or other vehicle, and the use of explosives. When using a mechanical device, it must be operated from a point as far as is practical from the building or structure being demolished. When a swinging weight, like a wrecking ball, is being used, the weight’s supporting cable must be as short as possible or restrained so it will not touch other buildings orstructures. Demolition and dismantling will begin at the highest point of a structure and work towards to the lowest point, unless this procedure would be dangerous to workers. When leaving the skeleton structural frame in place, masonry and loose material must be removed systematically and continuously from the highest to the lowest points. Any work above a tier or floor must be completed before the tier supports or floor are affected by the work of demolition or dismantling. Before demolition, all glass on an outside wall, such as windows and doors must be removed or protected to prevent the glass from breaking during demolition. Mechanical demolition is often used so that glass can be demolished during the process, not before. Masonry walls must be removed in reasonably level courses. When working on a masonry wall, do not loosen or allow material to fall when they could endanger a person or the structural stability of a scaffold, a floor, or other support of the building or structure. When removing material, while standing on top of a wall, pier or chimney, there must be flooring, scaffolding or staging provided on all sides of it that is not more than 2.4 metres below the place where the worker is working. Before a truss, girder or other structural piece is disconnected, it must be relieved of all loads, other than its own weight, and have temporary support. Basements, cellars or any excavated area left, after the structure above is removed, must have fencing along all the open sides or be backfilled to grade level. If the basement or cellar has a roof, floor or solid covering with fastened planks to cover open areas, fencing or backfilling is not necessary. Housekeeping Waste from a demolition project must be taken to a disposal area and reusable material to a storage area at least once a day and as often as is necessary to keep the site safe for workers and others. Please note that Ontario has a waste sorting and recycling regime covered in Ontario Regulations 102/94 and 103/92. Garbage and recyclable materials must be lowered by chute into containers. Alternatively, these materials can be lowered by crane or hoist. Any materials falling freely during the demolition or dismantling must fall into designated enclosed areas. People must not have access to these designated areas. Chutes must: be adequate for their jobs and rigidly secured; be enclosed on four sides when its slope is more than a gradient of one in one; have a gate at the bottom if it is necessary to control the flow of material. The entrance to a chute: cannot allow any material to spill when materials are being deposited into a chute, if it is at or below floor level, it must have a curb that is at least 100 millimetres high, cannot be more than 1.2 metres high, must be closed when not being used, and must be designed so that people cannot or are discouraged from entering the chute. At the end of every chute there be must a container or an enclosed, barrier, or fenced-in area."

    "subject": "Electrical_hazards_flash",
    "header": "Electrical Hazards - Flash Hazards",
    "talk": "An “arc flash hazard” is defined by the CSA Z462-15 Workplace Electrical Safety as a “dangerous condition associated with the release of energy caused by an electric arc”. An arc flash is a dangerous condition which involves an explosion, and can result in serious injuries, burns, and damage to the lungs, eardrums, and eyes. Arc flashes may also cause death. These conditions can lead to arc flash: accidental contact between two conductors wiring errors insulation deterioration or failure corrosion of equipment contamination of the equipment (e.g., dust, moisture) animals, tools, or fallen parts that short-circuit the equipment poor/lack of maintenance workers using improper or non-rated tools equipment failures, overload, improper use, human error. An electrical hazard is considered to be removed when protective measures/controls are put in place at the source (e.g., remove the hazard or de-energize), or along the path (e.g., place electrical insulation or a barrier between the worker and the electrical hazard). Where PPE only is needed for worker protection, an electrical hazard is considered to remain and it is necessary to address safety requirements for other workers in the area. Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed according to the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. The above electrical work is performed under the authority of the electrical utility and the electrical work is performed by authorized workers (workers are given formal permission from the owner and employer and they are competent to perform work on and in proximity to electrical transmission and distribution systems). Examples are powerline technicians that are performing approved work methods to install and maintain electrical transmission and distribution systems. Electrical work outside of the above scope must be performed according to the following requirements. Electrical tools and equipment must meet industry standards. Examples may include, but not limited to, voltage rated tools, correct categories of diagnostic equipment, multi-meters, proximity testers, amp meters and other diagnostic equipment as required, non-conductive ladders, non-conductive scaffolding, voltage rated gloves, and appropriate arc flash protective equipment and clothing. Workers must be trained in and familiar with the tools, equipment and protective devices including personal protective equipment as defined from regulations and/or standards. Workers must follow documented safe work procedures and practices to make sure that they are protected from electrical hazards associated with the work. Only the authorized person (authorized by the supervisor in charge of the project) may enter a room or other enclosure that contains exposed energized electrical parts. The entrance to this room or enclosure must be marked with warning signs stating that unauthorized people may not enter. Electrical hazards must be identified, workers shall be protected from the electrical hazards to what they are exposed. All tools, devices and equipment, including personal protective equipment, that are used for working on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installations or conductors must be designed, tested, maintained, and used in ways that provide protection to workers. When working on or near exposed energized machinery and other apparatus, arc flash, flame resistant clothing and other personal protective equipment (PPE) must provide an adequate level of protection to protect the worker the outer layer of clothing must be made of arc flash, flame resistant material other clothing worn with arc flash, flame resistant PPE must not contribute to increased worker injury PPE used must be manufactured, tested and maintained to current recognized industry standards workers shall wear approved eye protection in all circumstances where there is a possibility of an electrical flash or arc. From the Electrical Utility Safety Rules , s. 113. Electrical arc flash hazards must be identified. Workers that are exposed to arc flash hazards must be adequately protected from the arc flash hazards. This protection is most commonly achieved through an arc flash hazard risk assessment or the application of task tables from the electrical standards. The risk assessment would include the assessment of the equipment or devices to determine the potential incident energy that may be produced in the case of an electrical incident. Arc flash risk assessments also help establish safe work procedures for the electrical workers when performing electrical tasks. The risk assessments allow the worker to determine the safe approach boundaries for contact and arc flash hazards. Workers who may be exposed to electrical shocks or burns from flash hazards must be trained to use and wear voltage rated rubber gloves and leather protectors as necessary. Rubber gloves must be worn with adequate leather protectors and cannot be worn inside out. Leather protectors must be visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Inadequate or damaged gloves or protectors should not be used. Workers must be trained in the proper use, care, and storage of rubber gloves and leather protectors. Voltage rated rubber gloves shall be used and maintained according to the manufactures recommendations and industry standards as prescribed. Rubber gloves with leather protectors, arc flash protective clothing and equipment, voltage rated tools and defined shock hazard boundaries are the most common protective equipment and measures used for shock protection. All protective rubber gloves must: protect the worker against electrical shock and burn, and be air tested and visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Rubber gloves rated for voltages above 5,000 volts AC must be tested and certified that they can withstand the voltages for which they are rated: at least once every three months, if they are in service, and at least once every six months, if they are not in service. NOTE: Voltage rated gloves must meet approved industry standards. They shall be maintained on intervals as prescribed by the manufacture or industry standards, in addition to the requirements from provincial regulations. Specific care and maintenance standards can be found within CSA Z462-15 Workplace Electrical Safety or CAN/UL S 801 Electric Utility Workplace Electrical Safety for Generation, Transmission, and Distribution."

    "talk": "Lockout is a procedure that prevents the release of hazardous energy. It often involves workers using a locking device to keep a switch in the “off” position, or to isolate the energy of moving parts. This procedure prevents electric shock, sudden movement of components, chemical combustion, falling counterweights, and other actions that can endanger lives. Lockout is a physical way to ensure that the energy source is de-energized, deactivated, or otherwise inoperable. Tagging tells others that the device is locked out, who has locked it out, and why. Tagged devices and systems must not be re-energized without the authority of those named on the tag. There are four documents in this series. Please also see flash hazards , working on energized systems , and operating equipment near energized systems . Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed in accordance with the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. All electrical hazards must be identified. Electrical hazards then must be removed as to not create a hazard to workers. If electrical hazards cannot be removed, workers must be adequately protected from the electrical hazards. Workers must follow written procedures and apply measures to ensure that workers do not become injured from the electrical hazards. Before work is done near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment or an electrical installation or conductor workplaces must: : have written procedures that adequately protect workers from electrical shock and burn have copies of the procedures available to every worker on the project ensure workers follow the written procedures Hazardous stored electrical energy must be adequately discharged or contained before the work begins, and kept this way while the work continues. Workers must verify that the power supply and the hazardous stored energy have been disconnected, discharged or contained and will remain so as the work continues. Test before touch, and follow safe work procedures to ensure electrical energy has been discharged though the lock out tag out procedures. When using tags, the tag must: be made of non-conducting material be installed in a way that it cannot become energized be placed in a highly visible location be secured to prevent its inadvertent removal not be removed until the machinery or system is unlocked Each tag must indicate: the reason why the equipment, installation or conductor is disconnected the name of the person who disconnected the equipment, installation or conductor the name of employer, and the date and time of the lockout. When there are multiple workers using machinery or energized systems, workers must have a way to communicate the status of the hazardous stored electrical energy and electrical equipment, installation or conductor. There are times when disconnecting conductors, installations or equipment is not practical or possible. See the document Electrical Hazards – Working on energized systems for more information."

    "talk": "Overhead powerlines are frequently hit by construction equipment such as dump trucks and cranes; however, elevating work platforms and other equipment such as ladders and rolling scaffolds are also involved. Many powerline contacts involve low-voltage service and buried cable. Electrical shock is the passing of electric current through the body. Electrical current can cause ventricular defilation, cardiac arrest, involuntary physical movements, including preventing you from releasing your grip from a live conductor, throw you into contact with a higher voltage conductor, cause you to lose your balance and fall, cause severe internal and external burns, and can kill you. There are four documents in this series. Please also see flash hazards , working on energized systems , and lockout and tagging . Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed in accordance with the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. Sections 182, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191 and 193 do not apply to electrical work that is performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems if the work is performed in accordance with the document referred to above. Electrical work performed on a construction project must be performed by an electrician as prescribed in the provincial regulations. Electrical hazards must be identified on the construction projects and only competent persons shall be permitted to perform work on or near electrical systems or apparatus. Every reasonable precaution shall be taken to ensure workers are protected from electrical hazards. This action includes the locking/tagging out of electrical equipment, identifying powerlines and electrical systems that both part of the construction activities and not part of construction activities. Examples include power lines overhead and underground, high and low voltage services, and distribution/transmission systems.Communicating with neighbouring electrical system owners to ensure the construction activities do not encroach or interfere with local distribution/transmission or services to neighbouring properties may also be necessary. Written safe work procedures must be in place to ensure all workers are protected from electrical hazards depending on the scope, impact and potential and actual hazards to the workers. The written safe work procedures must be communicated to all workers and when necessary to neighbouring electrical systems to ensure workers are protected from the electrical hazards. Tools, ladders, scaffolding and other equipment or material that is able to conduct electricity must not be stored or used so close to energized electrical equipment, installations or conductors that they can make electrical contact. When work is to be done on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installation or conductor, the employer must: Establish and implement written measures and procedures that comply with the law, and ensure workers are protected from electrical shock and burn, and Make a copy of the written measures and procedures available to every worker on the project. The worker must follow the written measures and procedures. When objects could be near live overhead powerlines, minimum safe distances are required: Normal phase-to-phase voltage rating Minimum distance 750 or more volts, but no more than 150,000 volts 3 metres More than 150,000 volts, but no more than 250,000 volts 4.5 metres More than 250,000 volts 6 metres Written measures and procedures include the following: Place adequate warning devices in the area of the electrical hazard so at least one is always visible to the operator. Provide a sign that meets specified requirements, for example, “Danger! Electrical powerlines overhead.” Make sure the operator has been provided with written notification of the electrical hazard before beginning the work. Make sure there is a sign warning of the hazard that is visible to the operator at the operator’s station. Before a worker starts work, make sure that the employer provides and explains the procedures to the worker. A competent worker must be designated as a signaller to warn the operator when any part of the equipment, load, or hoist line may approach the minimum distance. The signaller must be in full view of the operator and have a clear view of the equipment and the conductor. An exemption to these measures is only allowed if, under the authority of the owner of the electrical conductor, protective devices and equipment are installed, and written procedures are implemented that are adequate to protect the workers from electrical shock and burn. Workers involved must use protective devices and equipment, and follow written measures and procedures."

Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. The above electrical work is performed under the authority of the electrical utility and the electrical work is performed by authorized workers, workers are given formal permission from the owner and employer and they are competent to perform work on and in proximity to electrical transmission and distribution systems. Examples are powerline technicians that are performing approved work methods to install and maintain electrical transmission and distribution systems. Electrical work outside of the above scope must be performed according to the following requirements. Where work must be done on, or near enough to the hazard, to make electrical contact or near enough to be exposed to injury from an arc flash, work while the system is energized is permitted only if specific conditions are met. Testing/Diagnostic testing with a meter/testing device is considered to be working on energized equipment, and requires appropriate protection including electrical contact and arc flash personal protective equipment. Written safe work procedures are also required. Electrical hazards must be identified, workers shall be protected from the electrical hazards to what they are exposed. No worker can connect, maintain, or modify electrical equipment or installations unless they hold the appropriate certificate of qualification, or are otherwise allowed. Workers who do not hold these qualifications are allowed to attach a cord of an electrical equipment or tool and remove it from a receptacle. Only the authorized person (authorized by the supervisor in charge of the project) may enter a room or other enclosure that contains exposed energized electrical parts. The entrance to this room or enclosure must be marked with warning signs stating that unauthorized people may not enter. Electrical equipment, installations, conductors, and insulating materials must be suitable for their intended use, and be installed, maintained, modified, and operated in a way that is not a hazard to a worker. Electrical equipment, installations and conductors that are not used for the purpose they were designed for must be removed, left in an electrically non-hazardous condition by being disconnected, de-energized, tagged, and either grounded if a power line or locked out if it is electrical equipment. Electrical tools and equipment must meet industry standards examples may include but not limited to voltage rated tools, correct categories of diagnostic equipment, multi-meters, proximity testers, amp meters and other diagnostic equipment as required, non-conductive ladders, non-conductive scaffolding, voltage rated gloves, appropriate arc flash protective equipment and clothing. Workers shall be trained in and familiar with the tools, equipment and protective devices including personal protective equipment as defined from regulations. Workers shall follow documented safe work procedures and practices to ensure that they are protected from electrical hazards associated with the work. Tools, ladders, scaffolding and other equipment or material that is able to conduct electricity must not be stored or used so close to energized electrical equipment, installations or conductors that they can make electrical contact. When work is to be done on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installation or conductor, the employer must: Establish and implement written measures and procedures that comply with the law, and ensure workers are protected from electrical shock and burn, and Make a copy of the written measures and procedures available to every worker on the project. The worker must follow the written measures and procedures. The power supply to the electrical equipment, installation or conductor must be disconnected, locked out of service, and tagged before the work begins. It must also be kept in this state while the work continues. Hazardous stored energy must be adequately discharged or contained before the work begins, and kept in that state while the work continues. Workers must verify that these conditions are met before beginning work. Work on energized equipment is permitted only if: it is not reasonably possible to disconnect the equipment, installation, or conductor from the power supply, the equipment is rated at a nominal voltage of 600 volts or less, and disconnecting the equipment would create a greater hazard to workers than proceeding without disconnecting it, or the work consists only of diagnostic testing. All tools, devices and equipment, including personal protective equipment must be designed, tested, maintained so that they provide adequate protection to workers when they are working on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installations or conductors. Defective electrical equipment and tools that may be a hazard must be immediately disconnected, removed from service, and tagged as being defective. Any case of a ground fault or the tripping of a ground fault circuit interrupter must be immediately investigated to determine the hazard. Corrective action must be taken immediately. Unless the work consists only of diagnostic testing or involves a nominal voltage under 300 volts, an adequately equipped competent worker who can perform rescue operations, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), must be stationed where he or she can see the workers performing the live work. Work on energized equipment nominally rated greater than 400 amperes and greater than 200 volts, or greater than 200 amperes and greater than 300 volts, can only be done if: the owner of the equipment provides the employer and the constructor with a record showing that it has been maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications a copy of the maintenance record is readily available at the project the employer has determined from the maintenance record that work on the equipment can be performed safely without disconnecting it before beginning live work, the worker has verified that requirements have been met workers must use mats, shields or other protective devices or equipment, including personal protective equipment, adequate to protect the worker from electrical shock and burn Workers who may be exposed to electrical shocks or burns from flash hazards must be trained to use and wear rubber gloves and leather protectors when necessary. Rubber gloves must be worn with adequate leather protectors and cannot be worn inside out. Leather protectors and rubber gloves must be visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Inadequate or damaged gloves or protectors should not be used. Voltage rated rubber gloves shall be used and maintained as per the manufactures recommendations and industry standards. Rubber gloves, leather protectors and defined shock hazard boundaries are the most common protective measures and equipment used for shock protection. All protective rubber gloves must: protect the worker against electrical shock and burn, and be air tested and visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Rubber gloves rated for voltages above 5,000 volts ACmust be tested and certified that they can withstand the voltages for which they are rated.

    "header": "Emergency Procedures and Rescue of Workers",
    "talk": "In order for everyone to be prepared for emergencies, every project needs an emergency response plan before work begins. An emergency is any situation that has the potential to harm the life, health, or safety of a person, public property, or the environment. The purpose of an emergency response plan is to make sure that emergency procedures are in place and every worker is prepared to respond to any emergency in a correct, timely, consistent, and dependable manner. Emergency procedures at the project Constructors are responsible for ensuring that each project has written emergency procedures and that these procedures are followed. All emergency procedures must be reviewed with any joint health and safety committees or the health and safety representatives, if present. Emergency procedures must be posted in main area where it can be seen by workers at the project. Every worker must have ready access to a telephone, two-way radio or other system of two-way communication in the event of an emergency. Rescue of Workers Underground Before work at a project begins employers must have emergency procedures for rescuing underground workers. Post copies signed by the employer and supervisors of underground workers around the project. Practice all these procedures and follow them in an emergency. At least four workers at a project must have underground rescue training by a competent person appointed by a Director. If there are fewer than four workers at the project, all the workers must be trained. Employers must supply rescue workers with appropriate and necessary rescue equipment and the workers must be readily available if an emergency arises. Rescue workers must have completed training within 30 days before work on tunnels begin and be retrained at least every thirty days. Before a project begins, the supervisor must designate a rescue worker to inspect and test all rescue equipment every thirty days. Self- Contained Breathing Apparatus If a tunnel and shaft’s combined length is more than 45 metres, every rescue worker must be given a self-contained breathing apparatus with a full facemask. A competent person must train rescue workers in the proper operation of the self-contained breathing apparatus. Training must be repeated every thirty days. If the underground space is less than 100 metres, the self-contained breathing apparatus must have a minimum rating for 30 minutes of use. If the underground space is between 100 – 150 metres, it must have a minimum rating for 60 minutes of use. For spaces longer than 150 m, it must be rated for at least 90 minutes of use. Every self-contained breathing apparatus that is designated for emergency rescues must be the same model by the same manufacturer. Keep the self-contained breathing apparatuses readily available and near an access point to underground work area. A sufficient number of self-contained breathing apparatuses must be available on the project at any given time (with four as a minimum) for all rescue work. A competent person must inspect every self-contained breathing apparatus at least once a month, or more often if required by the manufacturer. Self Rescue Respirator Workers who may enter a tunnel or shaft must be given their own self-rescue respirator which provides protection against hazardous gases. They must be trained to use, care and maintain the respirator as well as its limitations per the manufacturer’s specifications. Workers must keep their respirators nearby while working in a tunnel or shaft. Emergency Rescue of Workers from a Suspended Work Platform, Boatswain’s Chair or in a Hoisting Operation Before working on a boatswain’s chair and suspended work platform for the first time, workers must be trained in elements of emergency rescue procedures and workers must be able to competently use the emergency controls. Employers are ultimately responsible for ensuring a competent prepares written emergency rescue procedures for suspended work platforms and boatswain’s chairs. The site-specific work plan must include a copy of these procedures. Workers on these suspended platforms and boatswain chairs must be able to alert rescue workers in an emergency situation. Written emergency rescue procedures are also required in any hoisting operation and these procedures must be communicated to all workers. Construction Projects regulation also requires that before workers use any fall arrest system or safety net on a project, the employer must develop written rescue procedures."

    "subject": "Excavation",
    "header": "Excavation",
    "talk": "Trenching fatalities are mainly caused by cave-ins. Death occurs by suffocation or crushing when a worker is buried by falling soil. The terms “trench” and “excavation” are sometime interchanged; however, it is important to note the distinction between the two. An excavation is a hole left in the ground as the result of removing material, and a trench is an excavation in which the depth exceeds the width. The Excavations section of the Construction Regulation defines the various types of soils and specifies the type of shoring and timbering to be used for each. It also spells out the requirements for trench support systems that must be designed by a professional engineer. Types of Soil The Construction Regulation sets out four soil types. If you are unsure about the soil type, have the soil tested to confirm the type. Type 1 soil: is hard, very dense and only able to be penetrated with difficulty by a small sharp object, has a low natural moisture content and a high degree of internal strength, has no signs of water seepage, and can be excavated only by mechanical equipment. Type 2 soil: is very stiff, dense and can be penetrated with moderate difficulty by a small sharp object, has a low to medium natural moisture content and a medium degree of internal strength, and has a damp appearance after it is excavated. Type 3 soil: is previously excavated soil, or soil that is stiff to firm or compact to loose in consistency and has one or more of the following characteristics: it exhibits signs of surface cracking. it exhibits signs of water seepage. if it is dry, it may run easily into a well-defined conical pile. it has a low degree of internal strength. Type 4 soil: is soft to very soft and very loose in consistency, very sensitive and upon disturbance is significantly reduced in natural strength runs easily or flows, unless it is completely supported before excavating procedures, has almost no internal strength, is wet or muddy, and exerts substantial fluid pressure on its supporting system. The type of soil determines the strength and stability of trench walls. When excavating, the type of soil must be determined by visually and physically examining at the walls and within a horizontal distance from each wall equal to the depth of the excavation measured away from the excavation. This requirement means if an excavation is 3 metres (10ft) you would have determine the soil type 3 metres (10ft) away from the excavation (wall). When classifying the soil type, it is not uncommon for more than one type of soil at a single location. For classifying purposes, soil should be classified as the highest numerical class (most protective). Excavation - General Requirements No one may enter an excavation that does not comply with this legislation. When people are working in a trench, another worker must be working above ground close to the trench or its access points. Before beginning an excavation, employers and workers must make sure that all gas, electrical and other services in and near the area to be excavated are located, marked and shut down if they are a danger during excavation. In Ontario, the Ontario1Call service can help. If a service cannot be shut off or disconnected, the owners of the service must to supervise its uncovering during the excavation. Pipes, conduits and cables for gas, electrical and other services must be supported to prevent failure or breakage. When excavations could affect the stability of a nearby building or structure, constructors must make sure a professional engineer prepares written precautionary procedures and that these precautions are put in place. Excavations that workers might enter must be reasonably free of water. Workers in an excavation must have a clear work space of at least 450 millimetres between the wall of the excavation and any formwork, masonry or similar wall. The walls must be stripped of loose rock or other material that may slide, roll or fall upon a worker. When support is needed to prevent the spilling of loose rock, walls must be supported by rock anchors or wire mesh while cut out of the rock. A level area extending at least 1 metre from the upper edge of each wall of an excavation must be kept clear of equipment, excavated soil, rock, and construction material. The stability of excavation walls is to be maintained where it could be affected by stockpiling. Vehicles must be operated so that they do not interfere with the stability of an excavation’s walls. If excavations are more than 2.4 metres deep and people nearby could fall in, a barrier at least 1.1 metres high must be installed at the top of every wall that is not sloped (as described in clauses 234 (2) (e), (f) and (g) ). Support Systems Excavation walls must have a support system that complies with the regulation. The support system must provide continuous support for the excavation’s walls and may not be removed until immediately before the excavation is backfilled. A competent person must supervise this removal. When there is a support system in place, ladders and any exit points must be protected by the support system. Support systems for the walls must be installed progressively in an excavation in Type 1, 2 or 3 soil and in advance of excavations in Type 4 soil when practical. Unless otherwise allowed, support systems must extend at least 0.3 metres above the top of the excavation. Where there is foot or car traffic and the excavation is covered when not being worked on, the support system must extend at least to the top of the excavation. Sloped upper portions of the excavation walls must be sloped for the type of soil present (as described above or in clauses 234(2)(e), (f) and (g) ). Lower portions that are vertical or near vertical, must be supported by a system which extends at least 0.5 metres above the vertical walls. Before a support system is used, the constructor must submit 2 copies of the design drawings and specifications to the office of the Ministry of Labour nearest to the project. When a trench’s depth is larger than 6 metres or the width is larger than 3.6 metres, there must be an engineered support system designed for the location and project. A support system must be: must follow the timbering and shoring specifications laid out in the table specified in the regulation made with timbering and shoring that meets the requirements, if no hydrostatic pressure is present in the soil, and if the width and depth of the excavation are equal to or less than the width and depth indicated in the table specified in the regulation a prefabricated support system that complies with the legislation, a hydraulic support system that complies with the legislation, or an engineered support system that complies with section the legislation. Support systems are not required for exactions: that are less than 1.2 metres deep, where workers are not required to enter, that are not trenches and where workers are not required to be closer to the walls than the height of those walls, that are cut in sound and stable rock, made in Type 1 or Type 2 soil and whose walls are sloped to within 1.2 metres of its bottom with a slope having a minimum gradient of one horizontal to one vertical, made in Type 3 soil and whose walls are sloped from its bottom with a slope having a minimum gradient of one horizontal to one vertical, made in Type 4 soil and whose walls are sloped from its bottom with a slope having a minimum gradient of three horizontal to one vertical, or that are not trenches and not made in Type 4 soil and where a professional engineer has given a written opinion that the walls of the excavation are sufficiently stable that no worker will be endangered if without a support system is in place. Note for these projects, the professional engineer’s opinion must be kept on site and must include: the specific project and its location any specific condition for which the opinion applies, and the frequency of inspections Prefabricated, hydraulic or engineered support systems must be designed by a professional engineer and be constructed, installed, used, and repaired according to their design drawings and specifications. These drawings and other related documents must be kept on site while the system is in place. Any variations must be approved in writing by a professional engineer. If the type of soil is different than what system was designed for, a professional engineer must modify the drawings and specifications conditions or approve the system for use under the actual soil conditions. The system design must specify the size of the system and its type and grade of materials, the maximum depth and the types of soil for which it was designed, how to install and remove the system and proper location of the system in an excavation including the maximum allowable clearance between the walls of the support system and the excavation’s walls. With a hydraulic support system, the designs must indicate its minimum working pressure and outline the personal protective equipment required to protect a worker if a loss of hydraulic pressure occurs. A prefabricated or hydraulic support system may be used for repairing underground pipe breaks if the system: meets the general requirements, has four side walls, is designed for a maximum depth of 3.6 metres, is not used at a greater depth than 3.6 metres, is designed to resist all hydrostatic and earth pressures found in type 3 and type 4 soils, is installed so as to extend to the bottom of the excavation, is installed so that the walls of the system touch the walls of the excavation, and is not pulled forward after being installed in the excavation. In addition: prefabricated or hydraulic support systems cannot be used in type 4 soil, the space between the walls of a prefabricated support system and the walls of the excavation must be restricted to the minimum clearance required for the forward progression of the support system, and the walls of a hydraulic support system must touch the walls of the excavation. Sheathing must be: made of sound Number 1 Grade spruce and, placed vertically against the side of the excavation secured in place by wales, and driven into the soil and firmly secured in place if the excavation is made in Type 3 or 4 soil. Struts must be: made of sound number 1 structural grade spruce and, placed horizontally in the excavation and at right angles to the wales, and cut to the proper length and held in place by at least two wedges driven between the strut and the wales, and cleated with cleats that extend over the top of the strut and rest on the wales or that are attached securely to the wales by spikes or bolts. Wales must be: made of sound number 1 structural grade spruce and, placed, in the excavation, parallel to the bottom, or proposed bottom, of the excavation, and supported by either cleats secured to the sheathing or posts set on the wale next below it or, if it is the lowest wale, on the bottom of the excavation. Metal trench-jacks or trench-braces A metal trench-jack or trench-brace can be used instead of a timber strut: if the allowable working load of the trench-jack or trench-brace is equal to or greater than that of the timber strut, and if the size of the replaced timber strut is shown on the trench-jack or trench-brace. A professional engineer is required to determine the allowable working load of a metal trench-jack. The allowable load must be legibly cast or stamped on the trench-jack or trench-brace. Metal trench-jacks or trench-braces cannot be extended beyond the length used to establish the maximum allowable working loads. Every metal trench-jack or trench-brace: must be placed against the wales in such a way that the load from the wales is applied axially to the trench-jack or trench-brace, and must be adequately supported so that it does not move out of position."

CAN/CSA-Z259.14-01 (R2007): Fall Restrict Equipment for Wood Pole Climbing. Safety nets – ANSI/ASSE Standard A10-11-2010, Safety Requirements for Personnel and Debris Nets. Please Note: Standards are updated frequently. The Standards referenced in regulations may be out of date. To see the most current revisions go to the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) . Before any fall arrest system or safety net is used, the employer must develop written procedures for rescuing the worker after the fall has been arrested. The Construction Projects Regulations specifically address the following components in more detail: Lifelines and Lanyards Lifelines and lanyards are part of travel restraint and fall arrest system. Lanyards or lifelines must: Not be used in a way that it may be cut, chafed or abraded Not be subjected to extreme temperature, flame, abrasive or corrosive materials, or other hazards that may damage it Have the free end kept clear of equipment and machinery Only be used by one person at a time In the case of lanyards, have the connecting ends wrapped around a protective thimble and securely fastened with a swaged fitting or eye splice supplied by the manufacturer of the lanyard In the case of horizontal or vertical lifelines, be kept free from splices or knots (except when knots are used to connect it to a fixed support) Vertical Lifelines Only one person may use a vertical lifeline at a time. The vertical lifeline must extend to the ground, or have a positive stop that prevents the rope grab or other similar device from running of the end of the lifeline. Horizontal Lifelines Horizontal lifelines must be designed by a professional engineer using a standard or custom design. The design must show how the system is arranged including the anchor or fixed support system, indicate the components used, state how many workers can be safety attached to it, set out instructions for installation or erection, and show the design loads for the system. The system itself must be installed or erected, and maintained, according to the engineer's design. Before each use, the system must be inspected by a professional engineer or a competent worker designated by a supervisor. The constructor must keep the design at the project while the system is in use. Use the information in the resources tab to learn about other components of fall protection and fall prevention."

Formwork must also support the temporary weight of material such as bundles of reinforcing steel and live loads of workers and equipment. There are three stages in formwork operations: assembly and erection concrete placement stripping and dismantling To be done safely, each of these jobs requires planning, knowledge, and skill from both supervisors and workers. Design and planning are a supervisory function that may also legally require a professional engineer's involvement. Small construction and renovation jobs, however, sometimes call for design on site by workers. Formwork, falsework and re-shoring must be designed, constructed, supported, and braced so that they can withstand all their likely loads and forces. They must be inspected, before placement, by a professional engineer or a competent worker designated in writing by a professional engineer. Design drawings must be on site while the formwork, falsework or re-shoring is in use. The person carrying out the inspection must confirm in writing that the system was constructed according to the design drawings and have all available test results. Each design drawing by a professional engineer for the formwork, falsework, or re-shoring must: identify the components when a manufactured system is used show the size, grade and specifications of the non-manufactured system components if non-manufactured system components are used show the design loads for the structure and detail the bracing and external ties required to adequately support the design loads show the attachment points for rigging and hoisting if the structure is a unitized modular formwork or falsework structure intended to be lifted or moved as a unit set out the assembly instructions from the manufacturer or professional engineer Working loads: cannot exceed what the whole system was designed and constructed to bear cannot exceed the allowable load of any individual structural component cannot cause uplift, sliding, overturning or lateral displacement of a system must be established by a professional engineer must be established by testing the principal components to determine their strength using a method that simulates actual loading conditions and by applying a safety factor in accordance with good engineering practice Formwork and falsework may be removed if the concrete can support itself and any loads or the concrete and structure are adequately re-shored. If single post shores are arranged more than one tier high, each junction must be braced against a fixed support in at least two directions in order to prevent any lateral movement. Re-shoring must be constructed according to a professional engineer’s design drawings. Falsework and re-shoring must have sound and rigid footings capable of carrying the maximum load without settlement or deformation of the soil or structure below the footings.

In many cases, guardrails are the most reliable and convenient means of fall protection and they must be your first consideration. Employers to adequately protect workers with the highest ranked fall protection method that is practicable, the most protective being a travel restraint system to the least protective being safety nets. Guardrails or, if guardrails are impractical, other appropriate methods of fall protection or a protective covering must be used when: a worker could fall more than 3 metres (10 feet) from any location; there is a fall hazard of more than 1.2 metres, if the work area is used as a path for a wheelbarrow or similar equipment; a worker may fall into operating machinery, water or other liquid, or into hazardous substances or onto a hazardous object, or an opening on a work surface; a worker could have access to the unprotected edge of any of the following work surfaces and is exposed to a fall of 2.4 metres (8 feet) or more: a floor, including the floor of a mezzanine or balcony the surface of a bridge a roof while formwork is in place a scaffold platform or other work platform, runway, or ramp there are openings in floors, roofs, and other working surfaces not otherwise covered or protected including skylights there are open edges of slab formwork for floors and roofs Requirements for a guardrail system include: It must have a top and intermediate rail, and a toe board. The intermediate rail must be made of a material that can withstand a load of 450 newtons applied laterally (from the side) or vertically downward. The top guard rail must be between 0.9 and 1.1 metres above the surface. The intermediate rail must be located midway between the top rail and toe board. The toe board must extend from the surface at least 89 millimetres. When located on the perimeter (edge) of a work surface, the guardrail must be no more than 30 millimetres from the edge of the surface. A guardrail must be capable of resisting anywhere along its length and without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used—the following loads when applied separately: a point load of 675 newtons (150 lb) applied laterally to the top rail a point load of 450 newtons (100 lb) applied in a vertical downward direction to the top rail a point load of 450 newtons (100 lb) applied in a lateral or vertical downward direction to the mid-rail a point load of 225 newtons (50 lb) applied laterally to the toe board. Post may only be more than 2.4 metres apart if the guardrail system is capable of meeting the above specified loads. For guardrail systems made of wood, additional requirements include: The wood must be spruce, pine, or fir (S-P-F) timber of construction grade or better. The wood must not have any visible defect that may affect its load-carrying capacity. The wood must be free of sharp objects (e.g., splinters, nails). The guardrail system must have posts at least 38 by 89 millimetres, that are securely fastened to the surface, and are not more than 2.4 metres apart. The top and intermediate rail must be at least 38 by 89 millimetres. Note that if the guardrail system made of wood are constructed and installed so that it can resist all loads that may be applied by a worker, some subsections for load capacity may not apply. For guardrail systems made of wire rope, additional requirements include: Must have top and intermediate rails made that are at least 10 millimetres in diameter. Must be kept taut by a turnbuckle or other device. The outward deflection of the top rail and intermediate rail resulting from the loads specified in subsection (5) shall not extend beyond the edge of a work surface.

    "talk": "Many injuries result from poor housekeeping, improper storage of materials, and cluttered work areas. To maintain a clean, hazard-free workplace, all groups – management, supervision, and workers – must cooperate. Housekeeping involves many activities and items, including general disposal and storage of materials, storage of flammable, corrosive, or toxic substances, signage, lighting, ventilation, and others. General At least once a day and as often as is necessary, waste material and debris must be cleaned up and removed to prevent hazardous conditions. Garbage must be put in a disposal area and the reusable material must be put in storage. Garbage, debris and other materials cannot be allowed to fall from one level to another. They must be lowered by a chute, in a container or by hoist or crane. Material from a demolition on a construction project may fall or be dropped into an enclosed designated area that is not accessible to people. A chute must, be properly constructed and rigidly fastened in place be enclosed on its four sides if it has a slope exceeding a gradient of one in one have a gate at the bottom end if one is necessary to control the flow of material, and release into a container or an enclosed area surrounded by barriers. The entrance to a chute, must be built to prevent material from spilling over when it is being deposited into the chute if it is at or below floor level, must have a curb that is at least 100 millimetres high must not be over 1.2 metres high must be kept closed when the chute is not in use, and must be designed so that any person will be discouraged from entering it. If formwork ties, reinforcing steel, nails or objects jut out and endanger a worker, they must be removed, cut off or otherwise protected as soon as possible. The way material or equipment is stored or moved must not put workers in danger. Material or equipment that may be moved by cranes or hoists may not be stored under or close to an energized outdoor overhead electrical conductor. Blocking, support chains, metal bands, wire rope and rigging components must be removed from material or equipment in ways that do not put workers in danger. Material and equipment on a construction project must be piled or stacked so that they do not tip, collapse, or roll. Except for material in a building or a completely enclosed part of a building used only for storing and distributing materials, no material may be stored, stacked or piled within 1.8 metres of: an opening in a floor or roof the open edge of a floor, roof or balcony, or an excavation. These requirements do not apply to small masonry units (including bricks, blocks and similar objects) that can be handled by one worker; that are to be used at the edge of a floor, a roof, an excavation or an opening in a floor or roof; and that are stacked in a pile whose height is less than the distance from the face of the pile to the edge of the floor, roof, excavation or opening in a floor or roof. Storage Combustible, corrosive or toxic substances must be stored in a suitable container. Storage cylinders for compressed gas must be secured in an upright position. must have the control valve for compressed gas (other than a cylinder connected to a regulator, supply lines or hoses) be covered by a protective cap held in the proper position that are used (spent) may not be stored inside a building. may not be closer than three metres to a source of ignition or fire (except for a storage cylinder that is part of a hand-held propane tool, a lead pot used in plumbing or electrical work, a propane-powered or propane-heated vehicle, or propane storage cylinders). Propane storage cylinders may be closer than three meters if the source of ignition is protected by a barrier, wall or other kind of separation. Flammable liquids or gas must: be stored in a suitable building or storage tank. If practical, it should be stored 100 metres or further from explosive magazines for explosives. be in portable containers (that are used for storing or transporting) which are approved for the use of that liquid by a recognized testing laboratory. These containers must have labels explaining the approved use and the name of the testing laboratory which gave the approval. In general, only one normal work day’s supply of a flammable liquid may be stored in a building or structure on a project. More than this is allowed if it is in a suitable container that is stored in a controlled access area or a room that has enough window area to provide explosion relief to the outside and is remote enough from the entrances and exits of the building or structure. Signage Signs must be posted in prominent locations to warn workers of a hazard on a project. Signs must display the word “DANGER” clearly written in letters that are at least 150 millimetres in height. Signs must also state unauthorized people may not enter areas where hazards to workers are present. Specifically, signs must be posted: next to a hoisting area, under a boatswain’s chair, or a suspended work platform, at the outlet from a chute, at access points to areas that may contain noxious gases, vapour dust or fumes, noxious substances or a lack of oxygen, and where there are potential hazards from an energized overhead electrical conductor at more than 750 volts. Lighting Projects must adequately light areas where workers are present as well as entrance and exit spaces. Light bulbs used in temporary lighting systems must be enclosed by a mechanical protection device. Ventilation All projects must be naturally or mechanically ventilated where: workers could inhale noxious gases, vapour, dust or fumes and be injured workers could be harmed by a lack of oxygen gases, vapour , dust or fumes could form an explosive mixture with the air If natural or mechanical ventilation is not practical, appropriate respiratory protective equipment for the hazard must be provided to and used by workers. Except for internal combustion engines operating in a tunnel, internal combustion engines may not be used in an excavation, building or enclosed structure without an adequate supply of air for combustion. As well, exhaust from an engine must be adequately discharged far away enough from the excavation, building or enclosed structure to prevent its return. Exhaust must be ventilated so that it cannot accumulate in the excavation, building or other enclosed structure. Internal combustion engines must be maintained and used in accordance with section 93. Excavations, buildings or enclosed structures where an internal combustion engine is in use must be tested for airborne concentrations of carbon monoxide. This testing will ensure that the concentrations of carbon monoxide do not exceed the limits in section 4 of Regulation 833 (Control of Exposure to Biological or Chemical Agents). The Construction Regulation s further states that a written testing strategy must be developed by the employer and the joint health and safety committee or a representative, and competent workers must perform the tests. Drums, tanks, pipelines, etc. When drums, tanks, pipelines or other container need to be repaired or altered internal pressures must be adjusted to atmospheric pressure before any fastening is removed. They must be drained, cleaned and ventilated and must not have any explosive, flammable or harmful substance inside. Do not refill them during repair or alteration if the contents could vaporize or ignite. These restrictions do not apply to a pipeline if hot-tapping and boxing-in are done by a competent worker under controlled conditions and people are protected."

Ladders must be able to support the weight of the person working plus any equipment or tools, and be long enough to safely reach the area of work or access the next level. When using any ladder, always use the right ladder for the job. Inspect the ladder before each use. If portable, set up the ladder on a stable surface. Use three-point contact and take care when climbing. Falls from ladders are common to all trades and are one of the most serious safety problems in construction. Falls from ladders result in serious injuries and fatalities. There are four documents in this series. Please also see Ladders and Other Equipment - General , Ladders - Inspection , and Ladders - Set Up . The many types of ladders used on construction sites range from metal ladders permanently mounted on equipment to job-built wooden ladders. In general, the most common materials for ladders are aluminum, wood, steel, and fibreglass-reinforced plastic. Although aluminum ladders are popular and more widely used than wooden ladders in construction, they are also more susceptible to damage by rough usage. Aluminum ladders are good conductors of electricity and therefore must not be used near electrical hazards. Fibreglass-reinforced plastic side rails are also common and are generally used with aluminum rungs. They do not conduct electricity well and are resistant to corrosion. They are lightweight and available in various colours. They tend to be heat-sensitive and may be susceptible to deterioration after long periods of exposure to direct sunlight. Types of ladders include portable, step, trestle, platform, fixed, special purpose, and job built. The Ontario Construction Projects Regulations list specifications for certain types of ladders, including definitions of types of ladders. The following ladders have specific requirements: Portable ladders used at a project must be manufactured and meet the design, performance, test, and marking requirements of a Grade 1, 1A or 1AA ladder in the CSA Standard Z11-12 Portable Ladders. Any custom built portable ladder must have rungs spaced 30 cm on centre, side rails at least 30 cm apart, and a maximum side rail length of 9 m. Wooden portable single ladders must be straight grained and in good sound condition, and free of loose knots, sharp edges, splinters, and shakes. Wooden ladders must not be painted or stained with opaque materials that obscures the grain and might hide defects when inspecting the ladder’s condition. Cleat type rungs on a ladder must also have side rails that are at 40cm to 61 cm apart the side rails must be 3.8 x 8.9cm if the ladder is 5.8 m or less, or 3.8 x 14 cm if the ladder is longer than 5.8 m rungs that measure not less than 1.9 x 6.4 cm if the side rails are 40 cm apart, or 1.9 x 8.9 cm if the side rails are more than 40 cm apart rungs that are braced by filler blocks that are at least 1.9 cm thick and located between the rungs Double-width wooden ladders must also have three evenly-spaced rails that measure at least 3.8 x 14 cm rungs that measure at least 3.8 x 8.9 cm, extend the full width of the ladder, and are braced by filler blocks at least 1.9 cm thick a width of at least 1.5 m, but not more than 2m An access ladder fixed in position must: Be vertical. Have rest platforms at not more than 9 m intervals. Be offset at each rest platform. Where the ladder is more than 5 m above grade, floor, or landing, have a safety cage that starts not more than 2.2 m above the grade, and continues at least 90 cm above the top landing. The safety cage shall have openings to allow workers access to the rest platforms or the top landing. Have side rails that extend 90 cm above the landing.

Some learned the hard way. Almost 75% of North Americans will get low back pain at some point in their lives. But a back injury in construction and electric utility work can be more than pain; your future may be on the line. Back injuries account for approximately 35% of all lost time injury. A back injury may keep you off the job for good and can affect you at home, and the time you spend with family, friends, hobbies, and sports. You don’t need to learn the hard way. Back injuries are seldom the result of a single manual material handing task such as lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling. A serious back injury is usually the result of an accumulation of many small injuries over time. Every manual material handing task is important. What can you do to prevent a back injury? The best way to prevent a back injury is to keep your back in mind when working. Proper posture, housekeeping, heavy equipment, and the use of material handling equipment can help to prevent back injuries. There are no specific regulations that the outline measures related to materials handling or the prevention of back injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in Ontario. However, the lack of specific guidelines does not mean that employers and constructors have no responsibility for preventing back injuries or the development of musculoskeletal disorders. In general, employers and constructors must take all reasonable precautions to protect the health and safety of workers on a project. Their responsibilities include: all material or equipment must be stored and moved in a manner that does not endanger a worker identifying hazards on a project that could result in back injuries or musculoskeletal disorders establishing procedures to reduce exposure to these hazards and prevent back injuries and the development of musculoskeletal disorders informing workers and supervisors of relevant hazards promoting safety by providing workers with instruction and supervision confirming preventative measures are effective through ongoing review of hazards and procedures ensuring all equipment and materials being used are in good condition, including any personal protective equipment ; requiring the use of protective equipment where needed to prevent injury and protect against hazards ; Instructing and training workers in caring for and using protective clothing or equipment before use ensuring all workers follow safety procedures and use the personal protective equipment properly"

These injuries can either be individual injuries or contribute to the development of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) as the result of repeated strains and smaller injuries. Learn the safe way to mount and dismount. Construction Projects regulations states that construction equipment must have a means of access to the operator's station that will not endanger the operator, and must have skid-resistant walking, climbing, and work surfaces. A supervisor or competent person must inspect all machinery and equipment and any means of access and egress at the project to ensure that they do not endanger any worker. These inspections must be at least once a week or more often if the supervisor determines that inspection is needed to make sure the equipment or machinery will not be a danger to the worker. Keep running boards, treads, steps, footholds, and platforms clear of mud, ice, snow, grease, debris, and other hazards. In general, constructors and employers must take all reasonable precautions to protect the health and safety of workers on a project. See the document on “Manual Materials Handling, Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs), and Back Care ” for more information and to read the general duties applied to employers and contractors. To help prevent these injuries, make the following solutions part of your workplace health and safety program: Take your time. Assess the hazards, and mount and dismount with a slow, methodical approach. Take extra care in wet, snowy, icy, or other hazardous weather conditions. Remove any snow, ice, debris, etc. Mount and dismount only when the equipment is standing still. Climb down from the vehicle rather than jump. Use three-point contact (e.g., two hands and a foot). Only break three-point contact only when you reach the ground, the cab of the vehicle, or a stable platform. Use ramps and ladders where necessary to safely enter and exit trucks, trailers, and other heavy equipment. Always face in towards the machine or ladder. If jumping is necessary, sit on the edge and jump from a seated position to lessen the impact. Get on or off at the safest access position (normally part of the design by the manufacturer). Where necessary, retrofit equipment to provide safe access. Install slip resistant steps and grab rails to help workers mount and dismount equipment safely.

Typical construction work may involve equipment driven by large and small engines, metal fabrication, power drilling and sawing, air hammering, and blasting – all of which can produce noise at harmful levels. Depending on the noise level, duration of exposure, and other factors, a temporary or permanent hearing loss may result. Temporary hearing losses will usually be restored by the body within a few hours after the exposure has ended. Hearing losses which cannot be restored by the body over any length of time are permanent. Employers must: take all the measures reasonably necessary in each situation to protect workers from hazardous sound levels protection must include providing and use engineering controls, work practices, and where necessary, hearing protection make sure that any measurement of sound levels are to be done without accounting for hearing protection devices that may be used. To determine sound exposure levels use the formula listed in section 1 of the Noise regulation make sure workers are not exposed to sound levels greater than 85 dBA make sure workers wear and use hearing protection devices where it is not possible to limit the sound level to below 85 dBA if engineering controls do not exist or are not obtainable, are not reasonable or practical to use, install or provide because of the length or frequency of the exposure, the nature of the process or operation of work, or are ineffective because of a temporary breakdown or an emergency where practicable, post visible warning signs at all points where people may approach an area where sound levels regularly exceed 85 dBA train and instruct workers in the care and use of any hearing protection device they provide.

This document covers personal fall protection systems. The fall protection equipment document covers the components of a fall protection system. If your workplace uses fall protection systems, please also see the documents on fall arrest planning and anchor systems . Employers are to adequately protect workers with the highest ranked fall protection method that is practicable. If it is not practical to install a guardrail system, workers must be adequately protected by the highest ranked method possible of the following fall protection methods: Travel restraint system Fall restricting system Fall arrest system Safety net Before any fall arrest system or safety net is used, the employer must develop written procedures for rescuing the worker after the fall has been arrested. Employers must also make sure: that a worker using a fall protection system is adequately trained in its use and given oral (spoken) and written instructions by a competent person, that a worker using a fall protection system is meets the working at heights training requirements of Ontario Regulation 297/13, the person providing the training and instruction prepared a written training and instruction record for each worker and signs the record, the training and instruction record includes the worker's name and the dates of training or instruction, and these records are available to an inspector on request. 1. Travel Restraint System A travel restraint system must be made of a full body harness with adequate attachment points or a safety belt. The full body harness or safety belt must be attached to by lifeline or lanyard to a fixed support. The system must be inspected by a competent worker before each use. If any component is found to be defective, the component must immediately be taken out of service. 2. Fall Restricting System A fall restricting system is made of an assembly of components that are attached to a fixed support, and are used according to the manufacturer's instructions so that a worker does not free fall more than 0.6 metres. If the fall restricting system is designed for wood pole climbing, is made of an assembly of components, used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and does not allow the pole slippage to be in excess of that set out in the National Standards of Canada standard. All fall restricting systems must be inspected by a competent worker before each use. If any component is found to be defective, the component must immediately be taken out of service. If a worker using the system falls or slips more than 0.6 metres (or the distance specified for wood pole climbing), the system must be taken out of service immediately and not be used again until all the components have been certified by the manufacturer as being safe to reuse. 3. Fall Arrest System A fall arrest system must include a full body harness with adequate attachment points, and a lanyard equipped with a shock absorber (if appropriate) or similar device. The system is attached by a lifeline or lanyard to a fixed support. The system must be arranged so that a worker cannot hit the ground, an object, or a level below the work. If the worker falls, the worker must not experience a force greater than 8 kilonewtons (1,800 pounds). Although the regulations states a maximum force on a worker of 1,800 pounds, this level of force is considered very high. The CSA Standard Z259.11-05: Energy Absorbers and Lanyards limits the force a worker would see in a fall to 900 pounds. All fall arrest systems must be inspected by a competent worker before each use. If any component is found to be defective, the component must immediately be taken out of service. If a worker falls while using the system, the system must be taken out of service immediately and not be used again until all the components have been certified by the manufacturer as being safe to reuse. 4. Safety Net A safety net must be designed, tested, and installed according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)/American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE) Standard A10.11-2010, Safety Requirements for Personnel and Debris Nets. A safety net must be installed by a competent worker. The net must be inspected and the installation tested by a professional engineer or competent person under the engineer's supervision before it is put into service. The engineer shall document the inspection and testing. A copy of the documentation will be kept at the project site while the safety net is in service.

Ontario requires that operators be trained before using the tools and carry proof of training on the job. Any worker using an explosive-actuated tool must be trained in its safe and proper use and carry proof of their training. Workers must wear adequate personal protective equipment, including eye protection. Explosive actuated fastening tools must be inspected to ensure: they are clean, that all moving parts operate freely, the barrel is not blocked in any way, and they are in good working order. Explosive actuated fastening tools must be used with a suitable protective guard that is: at least seventy-five millimetres in diameter, mounted at right angles to the barrel of the tool, and centred on the muzzle end of the tool, if practicable. The tool must be inoperable unless: its muzzle end is held against a surface using a force at least 22 newtons greater than the force equivalent of the weight of the tool measured in newtons, and when a protective guard is centred on the muzzle end of the tool, the bearing surface of the guard is not tilted more than eight degrees from the work surface.

Riggers must be aware of physical and environmental elements that can affect hoisting safety, factors that reduce lifting capacity, and safe practices in rigging, lifting, moving, and landing loads. Riggers must also be familiar with the proper inspection and use of slings and other rigging hardware. Most crane and rigging accidents can be prevented by following safe hoisting and rigging practices. Competency Training Employers must make sure workers involved with hoisting operations are adequately trained and have clear instructions about the requirements, restrictions, and hazards. These workers include crane operators to be assisted by signallers and the signallers shall be competent workers trained according to the regulation. Workers involved in rigging operations near overhead powerlines must receive training to the site specific procedures required to avoid coming into proximity to the electrical hazard. A competent worker designated as a signaller must be stationed in view of the powerline and the operator. Design drawings Constructors must keep all design drawings, test reports, written statements, and certification documents with the crane at all times during the hoisting operation, and must provide inspectors with copies when requested. Constructor must keep signed design drawings while the tower crane is erect. Cables, Slings & Rigging Cables used by cranes or similar hoisting device are attached to the crane and above the hook. The cable is the operators, not a riggers responsibility. Cables used by hoisting devices must: be steel wire rope of the type, size, grade, and construction recommended by the manufacturer; be compatible with the sheaves and the drum; be lubricated; not be spliced; have its end connections securely fastened; be kept with at least three full turns on the drum. Cables used by a crane or similar hoisting device CANNOT: contain six randomly-distributed wires that are broken in one rope lay or three or more wires that are broken in one strand in a rope lay; be smaller than its nominal rope diameter by more than, 1 millimetre for a diameter up to and including 19 millimetres, 2 millimetres for a diameter greater than 19 millimetres up to and including 29 millimetres, and 3 millimetres for a diameter greater than 29 millimetres; be worn by more than one-third of the original diameter of its outside individual wires; show evidence of kinking, bird-caging, corrosion or other damage resulting in distortion of the rope structure; or show any sign of possible rope failure including rope damage caused by contact with electricity. Static cables and cables used for pendants cannot have: three or more broken wires in one lay or in a section between end connectors; or more than one broken wire at an end connector. Do not use rotation-resistant wire rope for a cable for boom hoist reeving and pendants or where an inner wire or strand for a cable is damaged or broken. Cables used by a crane or similar hoisting device must be capable of supporting at least: three and a half times the likely maximum load if it is used on a device other than a tower crane and the cable winds on a drum or passes over a sheave; five times the likely maximum load if it is used on a tower crane and the cable winds on a drum or passes over a sheave; three times the likely maximum load if it is a pendant or is not subject to winding or bending; and ten times the likely maximum load if the crane or similar hoisting device is used for supporting persons. Cables used by a cranes or similar hoisting devices must be attached by: by binding and fastening the cable around an oval thimble so that the cable thimble cannot separate; or by fastening the cable within a tapered socket by means of virgin zinc or a wedge-type socket fitted with a wire rope clip at the dead end to prevent accidental release or loosening of the wedge. The dead end cable of a wedge socket assembly on a hoisting line must extend between 100 millimetres and 300 millimetres out of the socket. Slings The term “sling” includes a wide variety of configurations for all wire ropes, metal mesh, chains, and synthetic webs. Containers, slings or similar devices must be: suitable for its intended use (for example, do not use to tow a vehicle); suitable for and capable of supporting the object being rigged or hoisted; arranged to prevent the whole object or any part it from slipping or falling; capable of supporting at least five times the likely maximum load and at least ten times the likely load if it will be used to support a person. Web-type fabric or nylon slings or anything similar must have a load rating capacity label and may not be used if it may be cut. Use abrasion protection and cut protection pads. Hooks Hoisting hooks must have a safety catch except when they are used in placing structural members if the method of placing protects workers as much as a safety catch would. Do not use a hook that is cracked, has a throat opening bigger than the manufactured opening or is twisted from the plane of the unbent hook. Hoisting hooks and hook blocks must be cast or stamped to display their load rating legibly cast in a location that visible during its use. Overhauling weights must be prevented from sliding up or down and be securely attached to the load hook and the cable. As well, they may not be split. Chains Only use an alloy steel chain or a chain manufactured specifically for hoisting. Alloy steel chains may not be annealed or welded. Chains used for hoisting must be: labelled with its load capacity rating; repaired or reconditioned according to the manufacturer’s specification; tested after being repaired or reconditioned; visually inspected by a competent worker as often as necessary according to the manufacturer’s recommendation and at least once a week when the chain is in service. Clamps Friction-type clamps must be used in ways that prevent an accidental slackening of the hoisting cable and releasing of the clamp. Guide Ropes and Tag Lines In some cases, workers can be in danger from the rotation or uncontrolled motion of a load being hoisted. Guide ropes or tag lines prevent this rotation or uncontrolled motion. When using guide rope or tag line, do not remove them until the load has landed and there is no danger of it tipping, collapsing or rolling. Piles and Sheet-Piling Piles and sheet-piling must be prevented from any uncontrolled movement while being hoisted, placed, removed or withdrawn. Only workers directly engaged in this work can be in the work area. Inspection Cables used by a hoisting device must be visually inspected by a competent worker at least once a week when it being used on site. Workers performing an inspection must record the condition of the rope or cable in a separate log for each hoisting device.

Where the legislation is less specific, such as in providing details about elements to be inspected and frequency of periodical inspections, it is recommended to follow the guidelines provided by the applicable standards. During a general inspection of a scaffold, confirm that the erection of the scaffold followed the design drawing before the scaffold is used identify any defects of the structure (e.g., missing parts, improperly fitted components, inadequate components), supports, or accessories verify that all required safeguards are correctly installed verify that the use and the load of the scaffold correspond to the structural specifications of the scaffold confirm that the scaffold is maintained in good condition and has not suffered any deformation Specific regulatory requirements Scaffold inspection before use:  Before placed in service a scaffold must be inspected to conform that the erection has been done in accordance with the design drawings. Supported scaffolds and work platforms must be inspected by a professional engineer or a competent person designated by the supervisor. This inspection must be stated in writing. Centre-pole scaffolds used in silos, suspended scaffolds with more than one platform,  suspended platforms that, together with its components, weigh more than 525 kg; and multi-point suspended work platforms must be inspected or a report prepared by  the appropriate person . Multi-point suspended scaffolds must be inspected by a professional engineer before each use at a new location (new anchorage point) Periodical inspections: Centre pole scaffolds must be inspected by a professional engineer at the earliest of: the twenty fourth erection since the latest inspection, or two years since erection or inspection, if used for a monolitical silo, or one year since erection or inspection, if used for a stave silo. If a scaffold is erected in an environment that could affect its structural components, (such as a corrosive environment), the adequate inspection frequency should be determined by a competent person. Multi-point suspended work platforms, suspended platforms, scaffolds and boatswain’s chairs operated by mechanical power must be inspected at least each week by a supervisor or a competent person appointed by the supervisor. Inspection records and retention The person who carries out the pre-use inspection of a scaffold must record in writing that the scaffolds was erected in accordance with the design drawings.   A professional engineer must inspect a suspected scaffold or suspended platform , and multi-point suspended work platform The constructor must keep the records of inspections at the project location (where the scaffold is used). An employer responsible for constructing a silo using a centre pole scaffold must keep with the scaffold, while the scaffold is in use, any written opinion by a professional engineer regarding the scaffold and a record of the frequency of use of the scaffold during construction What to look for when inspecting a scaffold Components When inspecting the components of a scaffold, a checklist that includes all critical components of the scaffold can be helpful. The drawing design should include a list with the critical parts that must be inspected. Lists with the components to be inspected are also included in each scaffold-specific CSA standard. Ensure that there are no missing components. Ensure that all components are free of defects and compatible with the scaffold. Stability: Supported scaffolds become unstable if higher than 4 times the base.  Make sure that the scaffold is tied at intervals of maximum 3 times the least lateral dimension measured at the base. Make sure that fittings and gear, including base plates or wheels are installed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Make sure that the scaffold is not overloaded."

    "talk": "Substandard work practice is one of the factors which increase the risk of scaffolding incidents. The consequences of scaffolding accidents may be extremely serious. It is important that all those responsible of and involved in scaffolding work apply all required safeguards and best practices in order to prevent accidents. General Safety Requirements As a constructor you must appoint a competent supervisor for the project if five or more workers are working on the project. As a project supervisor, you must supervise or appoint a competent person to supervise the work, and inspect temporary supports and means of access and egress at the project. As an employer, you are responsible to appoint a supervisor for the workers (when five or more workers work on a project), and ensure that the following safety measures are followed: The scaffold is adequately selected, and can sustain the load to which it may be subjected. Nobody uses a scaffold before it is inspected and it is assessed that it meets the design requirements. The scaffold is not overloaded. A sign containing the word “DANGER” and indicating that the access of any unauthorized person is forbidden is posted under the suspended scaffold. A mobile scaffold with pneumatic tires is not supported by the tires while used, erected or dismantled. A scaffold mounted on castors or wheels have the brakes applied when a worker is on. A mobile scaffold that is on castors or wheels and has a platform higher than 2.4 metres is not moved with a worker on it unless the scaffold is moved on firm ground and the worker uses a fall arrest system. Access and egress on the working platform is done either by ladders or stairs or from ground level or a floor or roof in the case of a movable suspended scaffold. Workers use a full body harness connected to a fall arrest system attached to a fixed support when: working on scaffolds at a height of 2.4 metres or more and where guardrails cannot be installed when on a mobile scaffold with a height over 2.4 metres and moving on a firm ground when getting on, off, or working on a suspended scaffold or when the suspended scaffold is traversed or moved vertically Workers who may use fall protection systems are trained by a competent person and the training meets the requirements of the Ontario Regulation 297/13 . Every lifeline is suspended independently from the suspended scaffold, platform or boatswain’s chair and is tied up to a fix support. Lifelines attached from the suspended scaffold are only permitted if the scaffold has more than one means of support or suspension and the failure of one means of support would not cause the collapse of all or a part of the scaffold. Working without using a fall protection system is allowed only on stationary suspended scaffolds that have guardrails installed in accordance with the regulatory requirements. The scaffold platform is maintained in good order, free of obstructions, ice and snow, and is treated with a material that ensures firm footing. The masonry units are placed directly on the scaffold frames or, if placed on the platform they do not exceed the load capability of the platform. Masonry units are distributed along the scaffold. The outrigger brackets supporting the mason’s work platform are not more than one metre below the platform where the masonry material is stored. Use of stilts when working or climbing up and down on a scaffold is prohibited. Enough clearance from overhead wires is maintained when moving scaffolds. The scaffold and any structure and equipment related to its support and operation are inspected as required by regulations and standards (See Scaffolds - Inspection topic for more information). A suspended scaffold is attached to the fixed support in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. A suspended platform, scaffold or boatswain’s chair that is operated by mechanical power is inspected daily by a competent worker. A multi-point suspended work scaffold is equipped with movement-limiting devices to prevent unintended movement when the scaffold is traversed. Signs indicating the live loads of a multi-point suspended work platform are posted in conspicuous places on the scaffold. Wind speed is monitored and the multi-point suspended work platform is not operated, traversed or moved if the speed of the wind is higher than the speed specified on the design drawing at which the work should stop. As a worker, you are responsible to: Work according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Participate in training to gain theoretical and practical knowledge in safe erection and use, and inspection of the scaffold. Participate in training in the use of fall arrest system. Apply acquired knowledge to identify and control hazards. Use scaffolding only when it is safe. Pay attention to surroundings and keep safe distance from overhead electrical conductors when moving a scaffold. Move rolling scaffolds by pushing or pulling at the base and not at the upper part. Use protective equipment when required. Inspect personal fall arrest system before each use. Access a supported scaffold by ladder or stairs. Do not bring equipment on the scaffold other than hand tools and that approved by a competent person. When moving the scaffold, secure equipment on the scaffold."

    "talk": "Scaffolds are temporary structures that consist of one or more elevated platforms used where work cannot be done on or from the ground, from a building or other permanent structure without hazard to the workers.  Selection of the wrong type of scaffold, improper design, erection, transport, or dismantling of the structure, as well as substandard work practice may lead to serious accidents. The hazards associated with scaffolding are: Failure of scaffold or supporting system Falling from heights Instability Collapse Falling object To prevent such occurrences, the constructors and employers have the responsibility to ensure that all activities related to selection, erection and dismantling of scaffolding are conducted by competent worker who have the knowledge, expertise and training required to correctly select, erect or dismantle a scaffold.  See the topic Scaffold – Erection for more details. Every scaffold must be designed and constructed meet or exceed support or resist requirements and must not be loaded in excess of the load it was designed to carry. .  A professional engineer must verify and certify the results of the test and corresponding rated load. Scaffolds must be constructed of suitable structural materials.  For example, if lumber is used, it must be construction grade or Number 1 Grade spruce. Other requirements are listed Scaffolds must be designed by a professional engineer in the following situations: Supported scaffolds exceeding: fifteen metres in height above their base support; or ten metres in height above their base support if the scaffolds are constructed of a tube and clamp system Suspended scaffolds that consist of more than one platform Suspended platforms that together with its components weights more than 525 kg must. Multi-point suspended work platforms Scaffolds can be grouped in two main types: supported and suspended .  This topic discusses supported scaffolds. Supported scaffolds are scaffolds supported from the ground by rigid elements such as outrigger beams, poles, legs, base plates, sills and posts. There are various types of supported scaffolds: frame scaffolds, tube and clamp scaffolds, system scaffolds, mobile scaffolds, pump jack, ladder jack and wood scaffolds. General structural requirements for scaffolds and scaffold platforms A scaffold must: Support or resist to two times the maximum load or force to which it is likely to be subjected, without exceeding the allowable unit stresses for the materials of which it is made; four times the maximum load or force to which it is likely to be subjected without overturning Resist three times the maximum load or force to which it is likely to be subjected without causing the failure of any component, if the scaffold has structural components whose capacity can only be determined by testing. Be constructed of adequate structural materials Have uprights braced diagonally in the horizontal and vertical planes to prevent lateral (side to side) movement; that the horizontal members are adequately secured, and do not have splices between the points of support; footings, sills, or supports that are sound, rigid, and capable of supporting at least two times the maximum load without settlement or deformation; fittings and gear, including base plates or wheels, installed according to manufacturer’s instructions, connecting devices between the frames that engages both  tension and compression appropriately, safety catches on all hooks, and vertical intervals are used and adequately secured which do not exceed three times of the specified dimension The rated loads for the scaffold must be stated in the design drawings. A scaffold platform must: Be designed and built to support and resist all loads and forces to which it is likely to be subjected and at least 2.4 kilonewtons per square metre Be at least 460 mm wide; have the planks laid tightly if its height is 2.4 metre or more; and have guardrails if higher than 2.4 metres Have all openings guarded Have safe means of access (ladders, stairs) if they are above ground level and cannot be moved to give access to a floor, roof or ground level Have each component secured against slipping from its support Be made of components each capable of supporting at least 2.2 kilonewtons . Wood platforms must: Have the planks made from Number 1 Grade spruce and bear legible identification Have the planks of at least forty-eight millimetres thick by 248 millimetres wide The wood planks must cleated or secured by other means against slipping, must be arrange so that their length does not exceed 2.1 metres, and must  go over their support at least 150 millimetres but less than 300 millimetres. .  For example, a frame scaffold is supported scaffold composed of standard metal frames of various widths, heights and load capacities. Widely used due to fact that they are erected and dismantled relatively easy.  If masonry units are placed on platforms supported by tubular metal frames, each frame leg of the scaffold must have a minimum working load of (a) twenty-two kilonewtons for standard frames, and (b) 16.7 kilonewtons for walk-through frames. The stringers of prefabricated stairs erected inside a tower formed by scaffold frame sections must have a maximum slope of 60 degrees from the horizontal. Mobile scaffolds include portable frame or tube and clamp scaffolds set on castor wheels or tires equipped with a breaking device on each wheel. The scaffold must be equipped with guy wires or outriggers if the height of the platform exceeds three times lateral dimension of the scaffold measured at the base or between outriggers (if used)."

Suspended scaffolds consist of one or more platforms suspended from a permanent or temporary structure overhead structure by non-rigid components, such as ropes and wire cables. Scaffolds can be grouped in two main types: supported and suspended.  This topic discusses suspended scaffolds. There are several types of suspended scaffolds, but all of them have the same main components: Work Platform Suspension system Guard rails A suspended scaffold or suspended platform must be designed based on good engineering practices, , and scaffold-specific requirements prescribed by the regulations. Types of suspended scaffolds include: Two-point suspended scaffold (swing stage) – One or more work platforms suspended by two ropes from an overhead fixed support and equipped with equipment that permits the up and down movement. It is the most used suspended scaffold. Single point suspended adjustable scaffold/boatswain chair – A platform suspended only by one rope from an overhead support and equipped with means to permit the platform to move vertically. Structural requirements for single and two-point suspended scaffolds include: The overhead fixed support or outrigger beams must be capable to support at least four times the maximum load to which it may be subjected. The outrigger beam must be secured against vertical and horizontal movement and must be tied back to the fixed support by a secondary line. The lines must each be capable of supporting the weight of the suspended load and of the supporting system. The distance between the outrigger scaffold and the wall behind is not greater than 75 millimetres. Specially designed and manufactured counterweights with affixed legible instruction for use should be securely attached to the outrigger beams. Stacked or tiered suspended scaffolds must have at least two independent means of support that would not fail at the same time. A boatswain’s chair must be at least 600 millimetres long and 250 millimetres wide and must be supported by wire rope of at least nine millimetres if the worker is using corrosive substances, flame-cutting or mechanical-grinding equipment. Multi-point suspended work platforms – means a suspended work platform more than 750 millimetres in width or a system of suspended work platforms in which any one platform is more than 750 millimetres in width that is supported from an overhead fixed support system by at least three primary load-carrying means of suspension to maintain the stability of the work platform or system of work platforms. A multi-point suspended scaffold must be designed by a professional engineer. The design requirements for multi-point suspended work platforms are complex. At minimum, the design must meet the criteria as set out in the regulations. The platforms must be designed in such a way that the failure of one means of support will not trigger the collapse or fail of any part of the platform even in the most adverse loading conditions including that the load factors, live and dead factors, and the safety factors will not be affected. The design drawings must include a statement attesting that the design meets the regulatory requirements, and information about the grade of the materials, component specification, loads and safety factors; and procedures for erecting, dismantling, traversing or moving the equipment"

Responsibilities are outlined in the legislation in particular for constructor, employer, supervisor, and worker. Before beginning work, it is important for everyone to know and understand their legal rights and responsibilities. A supervisor must: be competent ensure workers use the methods, procedures, and equipment required by the Occupational Health and Safety Act and Regulations for Construction Projects ensure workers use or wear the equipment or clothing that the employer requires. tell workers about actual or potential dangers. give workers written instructions when required on all safety measures and procedures take every precaution reasonable to protect workers. When a project that has five or more people working at the same time, a constructor must appoint a supervisor. The supervisor must personally oversee the workers at all times. If the supervisor cannot be present to oversee the work, an assistant, who is a competent person, must be appointed in his or her place. Similarly, an employer of five or more workers on a project must appoint a supervisor. The supervisor must personally oversee the workers at all times. If the supervisor cannot be present to oversee the work, an assistant, who is a competent person, must be appointed in his or her place.

    "talk": "Drivers are not able to see all people or objects when moving backwards. A person or object in a blind spot (where the driver cannot see you) can easily be hit by a moving vehicle. The best way to avoid incidents is to plan the work so the driver does not have to back up at all. Controlling where and when there is traffic on a site is critical to safety. If backing up is necessary, other controls may be needed such as identifying the work area clearly, creating barriers, using a backup alarm to warn others, using a signaller, and wearing high-visibility clothing. Education and training are essential for all workers. Reversing vehicles and equipment on construction projects pose a serious problem for personnel on foot. Fatal accidents resulting from workers being backed over by dump trucks and other equipment occur all too frequently. The main issue when vehicles and equipment are reversing (or “backing up”) is that the driver or operator's view is restricted. On construction projects, vehicles, machines, and equipment should only be used in reverse as little as possible. Such equipment includes shovels, backhoes, other excavating machines, and cranes as well as similar hoisting devices. When there will be vehicles and equipment working reverse, clear and visible signs must be posted warning workers. Dump trucks must have automatic audible alarms that signal backing up. When moving in reverse is necessary, the operator and signaller must: together, establish procedures or signs by which the signaller will assist the operator follow these procedures. Signallers must be competent workers and must not have any other duties while acting as a signaller. Before a worker can act as a signaller, the employer must ensure that the worker has been given adequate oral and written instructions in a language that he or she understands. The employer must keep on site a copy of the written instructions. A signaller must: stay out of the path of the vehicle, machine, or equipment and any load it is carrying stay in full view of the operator have clear view of the path that the vehicle, machine, or equipment and any load will be travelling watch those parts of the vehicle, equipment, or load that the operator cannot see communicate with the operator either electronically, by telephone or with a system of prearranged visual signals that are clearly visible.

Proper handling requires careful planning, training, and use of personal protective equipment or controls. Some hazardous products common in construction are: compressed gas (acetylene, nitrogen, oxygen) flammable and combustible products (solvents) oxidizing products (epoxy hardeners) solvents, coatings, and sealers silica acids and alkalis The Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHIMIS) is a system for providing health and safety information on the safe use of hazardous products in Canadian workplaces. WHMIS gives everyone the right to know about the hazards of products they work with and provides the means to find out that information. It does this through: hazard identification and product classification labels safety data sheets worker training and education In 2015, WHMIS was aligned with the worldwide hazard communication system known as GHS – the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. The terms WHMIS 1988 (for original WHMIS) and WHMIS 2015 are used when referring to the old and new systems. The roles and responsibilities for suppliers, employers and workers remain essentially unchanged in WHMIS 2015 from WHMIS 1988. Suppliers must: Ensure the appropriate classification of hazardous products. Provide labels. Provide Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) (formerly Material Safety Data Sheets – MSDSs). Employers must: Educate, instruct, and train workers on the hazards and safe use of products that they may encounter in the course of their work. Ensure that hazardous products are properly labelled. Prepare workplace labels and SDSs as necessary. Provide employees with access to up-to-date SDSs. Review the education, instruction and training program provided to employees – annually or whenever work conditions or hazard information changes. Workers must: Participate in WHMIS education, instruction, and training programs. Take necessary steps to protect themselves and their co-workers. Participate in identifying and controlling hazards. Labels WHMIS legislation requires that products used in the workplace that meet the criteria of “hazardous products” for WHMIS 2015 must be labelled (these are called “controlled products” under WHMIS 1988). In most cases, suppliers are responsible for labelling the hazardous products that they provide to customers. Employers must ensure that hazardous products that come into the workplace are labelled. They are also responsible for preparing and applying a workplace label, when appropriate. According to the Hazardous Products Regulations (Canada) labels should have a product identifier initial supplier identifier pictograms signal word hazard statement precautionary statements Supplier labels must be available in English and French. They may be bilingual (as one label), or available as two labels (one each in English and French). Another type of WHMIS label is the workplace label. The workplace label is produced by the employer for use in the employer’s workplace only and contains the following elements: the identity of the product; information for the safe handling of the product; and a statement that a material safety data sheet, if supplied or produced, is available. A workplace label is required when: a hazardous product does not have a supplier label or the label does not meet the Hazardous Products Regulations (Canada) a supplier label becomes lost or cannot be read. Alternatively the supplier label may be replaced a hazardous product is made at the workplace and used in that workplace a hazardous product is decanted into another container A workplace label is not required when the hazardous product is “Under the control of the person who decanted it', the hazardous product is used only during the shift in which the portable container was filled, and the contents of the portable container are identified. The other circumstance where a workplace label is not required is if the hazardous product is going to be used immediately, and if the product is not used right away, or if more than one person will be in control of the product, a full workplace label is required. Special labelling requirements exist for laboratory samples of a hazardous product. Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) are documents that provide information about a product's hazards and safety precautions. SDSs are usually written by the product's manufacturer or supplier. In some circumstances, an employer may be required to prepare an SDS (for example, when the product is produced and used exclusively in that workplace). Every product that is classified as a “hazardous product” under WHMIS that is intended for use, handling, or storage in a workplace in Canada must have an SDS. If a product produced in the workplace is a hazardous product, the employer is responsible for creating an SDS except where the hazardous product is a laboratory sample. In WHMIS 2015, every SDS must provide a date of last revision. SDSs are required to be accurate at the time of sale. An SDS must be updated by the employer as soon as practicable after significant new data about the hazardous product becomes available to the employer. Worker Education Employers must instruct workers who work with or who may be exposed in the course of their work to a hazardous product in the following: purpose, significance and contents of a supplier label and workplace label purpose, significance and contents of a safety data sheet safe use, storage, handling and disposal procedures for hazardous products including those contained or transferred in a pipe, piping system, process vessel, tank car, tank truck, ore car, conveyor belt or similar conveyance Education and training must be related to a workplace’s larger health and safety program and any other health and safety education or training. Employers must ensure that any education and training, and programs dealing with hazardous products are effective and that workers are able to work safely around potentially hazardous products.
