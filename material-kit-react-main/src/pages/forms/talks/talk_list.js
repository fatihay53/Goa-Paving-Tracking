    "talk": "Anchor systems are a critical part of the personal fall arrest system. Anchor systems may be permanent or temporary. A worker at risk of falling certain distances (see Guardrails ) must be protected by guardrails or, if guardrails are not practical, by a travel-restraint system, fall-restricting system, fall-arrest system, or safety net. This document covers anchor systems. Other than guardrails and safety nets, all other means of fall protection require anchors (e.g., travel restraint, fall restrict, fall arrest). The fall protection equipment document covers the components of a fall protection system. If your workplace uses fall protection systems, please also see the documents on fall arrest planning and personal fall protection systems . The Construction Projects regulations outlines the two basic types of anchor systems for fall protection. Permanent anchor systems must be used as the fixed support in a fall arrest system, fall- restricting system, or travel restraint systems if the following conditions are met: It has been installed according to the Building Code . It is safe and practical to use the anchor system as the fixed support. If these two conditions are not met, a temporary fixed system must be used. The temporary fixed system must meet the following requirements: A support used in a fall arrest system must be capable of supporting a static force of at least 8 kilonewtons (1,800 pounds) without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used. If a shock absorber or other support is used, the support must be capable of supporting at least 6 kilonewtons (1,350 pounds) of static force without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used. Other supports may also be used as long as they are used according to the manufacturer’s written instructions and the support is adequate to protect a worker. A support when used with a travel-restraint system must support at least 2 kilonewtons (450 pounds) of static force without exceeding the allowable unit stress for each material used. Despite the above listed requirements, capacity of a temporary fixed support may be determined by dynamic testing according to good engineering practice which ensures the temporary fixed support is able to arrest a worker’s fall. A fixed support must not have any sharp edges that could cut, chafe, or abrade fall protection components. For temporary fixed supports, it is always recommended that a safety factor of 2 be applied to the weight requirements above."

    "talk": "Asbestos was one of the first designated substances to be regulated in Ontario. It is governed by Regulation 278 – Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations. The regulation specifies methods and procedures for working with or around asbestos-containing materials. “Asbestos-containing material” (ACM) means material that contains 0.5 per cent or more asbestos by dry weight. The Regulation defines asbestos as any of six fibrous silicates as: Actinolite. Amosite. Anthophyllite. Chrysotile. Crocidolite. Tremolite. The Regulation applies to: every project and its owner every constructor, employer and worker engaged in or on the project the repair, alteration or maintenance of a building every employer and worker involved in the repair, alteration or maintenance of the building and the owner of the building every building in which material that may be asbestos containing material (ACM) has been used and the owner of the building the repair, alteration, or maintenance of machinery, equipment, aircraft, ships, locomotives, railway cars and vehicles and work on a building that is necessarily incidental to the repair, alteration or maintenance of machinery or equipment where it is likely that ACM may be handled, dealt with, removed or disturbed, and every employer and worker engaged in this work to which the requirements for asbestos under Ontario Regulation 490/09 do not apply the demolition of machinery, equipment, aircraft, ships, locomotives, railway cars and vehicles, and every employer and every worker engaged in the demolition. These people include contractors and subcontractors who perform work for or supply services to the employer. Note: An owner is defined in the Act and includes a trustee, receiver, mortgagee in possession, tenant, lessee, or occupier of any lands or premises used or to be used as a workplace, as well as a person who acts for or on behalf of an owner as an agent or delegate. The Regulation does not apply: to the owner of a private home that is occupied by the owner or the owner's family to the owner of a residential building that contains no more than four units, one of which is occupied by the registered owner or family of the registered owner However, the Regulation does apply to constructors, employers and workers engaged in private construction projects and repair or maintenance of such buildings. Establishing Whether Material is Asbestos-Containing The Regulation requires that U.S. EPA Test Method EPA/600/R-93/116 be used to determine: whether a material is ACM, the type of asbestos in the material, and the content of asbestos in the material. The sample must be randomly collected by a competent worker and representative of each area of homogeneous material. The minimum number of bulk samples required is established in Table1 of the regulation and if analysis establishes the material contains 0.5% or more asbestos by dry weight the entire area of homogeneous material is deemed to be asbestos-containing material. Restrictions on sprayed material, insulation, sealants Material that contains 0.1% or more asbestos by dry weight must not be applied by spraying or as thermal insulation if it can become friable. Liquid sealants cannot be applied to friable asbestos-containing material if the material is deteriorated or the material is insufficient to support the weight of the sealant. Information for Workers A worker must be informed about The location of all ACM. For each location, whether the material is friable or non-friable. For sprayed-on friable material, for each location, the type of asbestos or whether the material will be treated as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. The requirement to inform workers applies if the work involves ACM, is being treated as ACM, or is close proximity to the material and may disturb it. Demolition Demolition may only be carried out or continued when any ACM that may be disturbed has been removed to the extent practicable. This requirement does not apply to situations where demolition is required in order to gain access to the ACM that must be removed, in which case workers must be protected. Ongoing asbestos management in buildings This section applies if: The owner treats material as if it were asbestos-containing material. The owner has been advised of the discovery of material that may be ACM. The owner knows or ought reasonably to know that ACM has been used in the building. ACM has been confirmed by examination or by the owner who has had an examination of the material carried out. The owner shall: prepare and keep on the premises a record containing: the location of all ACM, whether the material is friable or non-friable, for sprayed-on material, if the material is known to be ACM, its type or a statement that the material will be treated as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. The record must be updated every 12-months and whenever the owner becomes aware of new information relating to the record. Give an occupier of the building notice in writing of information contained in the record. The owner must provide information contained in the report to an employer contracted by the owner’s employers notice in writing of information contained in the record if their work may disturb the material. Inspect the material at reasonable intervals to determine its condition. The owner must establish and maintain for his/her workers a training and instruction program dealing with asbestos hazards personal protective equipment (use, care and disposal) personal hygiene measures and procedures prescribed by the Regulation, and Subsection 8(8) requires that even where no work is being done to a building, if friable material used as fireproofing or acoustical or thermal insulation has fallen and is being disturbed, all work involving the material must cease and the owner must have the material examined as set out in section 3 in order to determine whether it is ACM. Examination is not required unless it is treated as ACM and in the case of sprayed-on material as a type other than chrysotile. If the material is ACM or treated as though it were, the owner shall have the material cleaned up and removed. If the material will continue to fall due to its deterioration the fireproofing or insulation must be repaired, sealed, removed or permanently enclosed by the owner. Employer Responsibility An employer shall advise the owner of a building if the employer’s workers discover material that may be ACM. Owner’s responsibilities before requesting tender or arranging work Before an owner requests tenders or arranges for demolition, alteration, or repair, the owner must have a report prepared stating whether any material that may be handled, dealt with, disturbed or removed is or is not ACM . This requirement applies whether the material is friable or non-friable. An examination of the material is required to determine if it is ACM or not unless the owner Knows the material is not ACM, or Knows the material is ACM and in the case of sprayed-on material the type, or The work is to be carried out as though it were ACM and in the case of sprayed-on material treated as though it were a type other than chrysotile. The owner shall prepare a report that identifies Whether the material is or is not ACM, or if the work is to be performed as though the material were ACM and in the case of sprayed-on friable material as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. The material condition and whether it’s friable or non-friable, and Drawings, plans and specifications to show the location of the material. The owner shall give prospective constructors a copy of the report. A constructor must provide the report to prospective contractors. A contractor must provide the report to prospective subcontractors.   Discovery of ACM during Work If material is discovered during work that was not referred to in the owner’s report and may be ACM, the constructor and employer shall immediately notify, orally and in writing, the Ministry of Labour, the owner, the contractor and the joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative for the workplace. The notice must include the: name and address of the person giving the notice, name and address of the owner, municipal address or description of where the work will be carried out, description of the work, starting date and duration, and name and address of the supervisor. Work with the material shall stop until it has been determined whether it is ACM or not or as though the material were ACM and in the case of sprayed-on friable material as though it contained a type of asbestos other than chrysotile. Notice of Type 3 and certain Type 2 Operations Before beginning a Type 3 operation, or removal of more than one square meter of insulation using a glove bag (Type 2), the constructor or employer shall notify, orally and in writing, the Ministry of Labour. The notice shall include: name and address of the person giving the notice, name and address of the owner, municipal address or description of where the work will be carried out, description of the work, starting date and duration, and name and address of the supervisor. Classifications of Work The regulation sets out three classifications of work which determine the measures and procedures, notification requirements, record keeping, medical surveillance and training and certification requirements for workers. In most cases, the constructor or employer in consultation with an appropriately qualified consultant determines the classification of work. Type 1 Operations Type 1 operations present the lowest exposure risk, generally including the installation or removal of ACM products that are non-friable, that is, material that is not easily crumbled between the thumb and the fingers, or is not already crumbled. The work must be done without damaging the material, or where the material will be damaged, the spread of fibres must be controlled by wetting the material and using non-powered handheld tools. Type 1 operations include: installation or removal of ACM ceiling tiles (less than 7.5 m2) without damage installation or removal of non-friable ACM , other than ceiling tiles, without damage breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable ACM that is wetted and where the work is done using non-powered hand-held tools, and removal of less than one square metre of drywall where ACM joint-filling compounds were used. “Damage” includes breakage, cutting, abrading, grounding, sanding, and vibration. Type 2 Operations The following types of operations are classified as Type 2 operations: the removal of all or part of a false ceiling to access a work area, if ACM is likely to be lying on the surface of the false ceiling enclosure of friable ACM application of tape, a sealant or other covering to pipe or boiler insulation that is ACM installing or removing ACM ceiling tiles that cover an area of 7.5 m2 or more if the work is done without damaging the tiles the removal or disturbance of one square metre or less of friable asbestos-containing material during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of machinery or equipment or a building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car, vehicle or ship breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding, or vibrating non-friable ACM using non-powered hand-held tools if the material is not wetted cleaning or removing filters used in air handling equipment in a building that has sprayed ACM fireproofing removal or disturbance of one square metre or less of friable ACM during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of machinery or equipment or a building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car glove bag removals of ACM insulation breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable asbestos-containing material if the work is done by means of power tools that are attached to dust-collecting devices equipped with High Efficiency Particulate Aerosol (HEPA) filters removing insulation that is asbestos-containing material from a pipe, duct or similar structure using a glove bag, or an operation that may expose a worker to ACM and is not classified as Type 1 or 2. Type 3 Operations Work with friable or non-friable ACM that has the potential to generate high concentrations of asbestos fibres in air is classified as Type 3. Type 3 operations include: removal or disturbance of more than one square metre of friable ACM spray application of a sealant to friable ACM cleaning or removal of air-handling equipment, including rigid ducting but not including filters, in a building that has sprayed ACM fireproofing repair, alteration or demolition of a kiln or furnace made, in part, of refractory materials that are ACM breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable ACM with power tools not attached to dust-collecting devices with HEPA filters, and repair, alteration or demolition of a building in which asbestos products were manufactured, unless the asbestos was cleaned up and removed before March 16, 1986. When working with friable ACM, drywall or ceiling tiles, the type of operation is based on the total area on which work is done consecutively in a room or enclosed area even if work is divided into smaller jobs. The Ministry of Labour must be notified if there is a dispute about the classification of an operation. Work on the operation must be stopped until the Ministry of Labour has provided its decision in writing. Respirators A respirator assigned to a worker must: be for his/her exclusive use must be fit-tested unless it is equipped with a hood or helmet be used and maintained according to the employer’s written procedures be cleaned, disinfected and inspected after each use have damaged or deteriorated parts replaced be stored in a convenient, clean and sanitary location. For suppled-air respirators: Compressed air used for breathing must meet the standards set ou tin Table 1 of CSA Z180.1-00 – Compressed Breathing Air and System (2000). If an oil-lubricated compressor is used to supply air, a continuous carbon monoxide monitor with alarm must be provided. For ambient breathing air systems, the air intake must be located in accordance with Appendix B of CSA Z180.1-00 – Compressed Breathing Air and System (2000). When respirators are used at work, the employer must establish written procedures for the selection, care and use of the respirators and those procedures must be reviewed by each worker required to wear a respirator. A worker who is required to wear a respirator must be physically able to perform the work while using the respirator. The following measures and procedures apply to Type 1 Operations Remove visible dust from surfaces with a damp cloth or HEPA vacuum. Use drop sheets of polyethylene or other impervious materials. Drywall containing less than 1 square meter of asbestos-containing joint compound must be wetted before and during the work. A wetting agent must be added to water used to control the spread of dust. Frequently, at regular intervals, and immediately upon completing work, dust and waste must be cleaned up, removed using a HEPA vacuum or by damp mopping or wet sweeting. Dust, waste and drop sheets must be placed in a container that meets this regulation. Drop sheets and Polyethylene sheeting used for barriers and enclosures shall be wetted and appropriately discarded and not be reused unless they are rigid and can be thoroughly cleaned. Compressed air must not be used to clean up dusts. Eating, drinking, chewing or smoking shall not be permitted in the work area. Although respiratory protection is not required for Type 1 operations, a worker may request one and the employer must provide it. The respirator must be NIOSH approved and selected in accordance with Table 2 of this regulation. The worker must wear and use the respirator. Although protective clothing is not required for Type 1 operations, a worker may request it and the employer must provide it. The clothing and it must be selected in accordance with this regulation. The worker must wear the protective clothing. Before leaving the work area the worker must decontaminate the protective clothing using a HEPA vacuum or damp wiping before removing the protective clothing, or place it in an appropriate waste container. Facilities must be available for workers to wash hands and face before leaving the work area. The following measures and procedures apply to Type 2 and 3 Operations A sufficient number of warning signs must be posted in the work area to warn about of the hazards. The signs must read “There is an asbestos dust hazard and access to the work area is restricted to personal wearing protective clothing and equipment”. A wetting agent must be added to water and used to control the spread of dust. Eating, drinking, chewing or smoking shall not be permitted in the work area. Use dust-tight, impervious waste containers suitable for the waste. The container must be identified and cleaned with a damp cloth or HEPA vacuum before being removed from the work area Dust and waste shall be cleaned up and removed using a HEPA vacuum or by damp mopping or wet sweeping and placed in a suitable waste container. Drop sheets shall not be reused. Polyethylene sheeting and similar material must not be reused. They must be wetted and placed in an appropriate waste container. Barriers and portable enclosures must be rigid. If they are to be reused they shall be cleaned by HEPA vacuum or by damp wiping. Every worker who enters the work area must be provided with a NIOSH approved respirator in accordance with Table 2 of this regulation. The employer must also ensure protective clothing is provided to workers that is impermeable to asbestos fibres, consists of a head and full body covering fitting snugly at the ankles, wrists and neck, and that suitable footwear is worn. If protective clothing is torn it shall be repaired or replaced. Compressed air is not permitted for cleaning dust from surfaces. Only persons wearing protective clothing and equipment shall enter the work area. Additional measures and procedures for Type 2 Operations A HEPA vacuum must be used to clean up any ACM that may be lying on the surface of a false ceiling when removing all or part of it for access. Damp wiping or a HEPA vacuum must be used to clean up friable material that is crumbled, pulverized or powdered and is lying on any surface before it is disturbed. Friable ACM that is not crumbled, pulverized or powdered and may be disturbed or removed during the work must be wetted before the work begins and throughout. Polyethylene drop sheets or other suitable materials must be used to prevent the spread of dust. For the following two operations if carried on indoors: removing all or part of a false ceiling to obtain access to a work area, if asbestos-containing material is likely to be lying on the surface of the false ceiling, or the removal or disturbance of one square metre or less of friable asbestos-containing material during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of machinery or equipment or a building, aircraft, locomotive, railway car, vehicle or ship. The spread of dust shall be prevented by using an enclosure of polyethylene or other suitable material that is impervious to asbestos (including, if the enclosure is opaque, one or more transparent window areas to allow observation of the entire work area from outside the enclosure), if the work area is not enclosed by walls, disabling the mechanical ventilation system serving the work area, and sealing the ventilation ducts to and from the work area. Before leaving the work area, workers must decontaminate using a HEPA vacuum or damp wiping. Facilities must be available for workers to wash hands and face before leaving the work area. For glove bag operations the following procedures apply in addition to the procedures required for Type 2 Walls, barricades, fencing or other suitable means shall be used to separate the work area from the rest of the workplace. The mechanical ventilation system serving the work area shall be disabled and all openings or voids including ducts must be sealed. Drop sheets made of polyethylene or other impervious material are to be placed under the work area. The glove bag must be made of strong and impervious material and equipped with: sleeves and gloves that are permanently sealed to the body of the bag valves or openings to allow insertion of a vacuum hose and the nozzle of a water sprayer a tool pouch with a drain a seamless bottom and a means of sealing off the lower portion of the bag, and a high strength double throw zipper and removable straps, if the bag is to be moved during the removal operation. A glove bag must have a proper seal otherwise it cannot be used. The glove bag must be inspected before it is attached to insulation jacketing or coating. The glove bag must be inspected before it is attached to pipe, duct or other similar structure and at regular intervals and shall not be used if defects are detected. The contents of the glove bag must be wetted and the disposed of along with the glove bag in an appropriate container. The work area shall be cleaned by HEPA vacuum before removal work is resumed. The air inside the bag shall be removed through an elasticized valve, by means of a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter. The pipe, duct or similar structure shall be wiped down and sealed with a suitable encapsulant and the glove bag, with the waste inside, shall be placed in an appropriate waste container. The work area shall be cleaned by damp wiping or by HEPA vacuum. Additional Measures and Procedures for Type 3 Operations The work area shall be separated from the rest of the workplace by walls, the placing of barricades or fencing or other suitable means. The following procedures apply to Type 3 operations involving breaking, cutting, drilling, abrading, grinding, sanding or vibrating non-friable asbestos-containing material, if the work is done by means of power tools that are not attached to dust-collecting devices equipped with HEPA filters. Polyethylene enclosures or other suitable impervious materials must be used if the work area is not enclosed by walls. The enclosure must also include one or more transparent windows to allow observation from outside the enclosure. A curtain made from polyethylene or other suitable impervious material must be installed at each entrance or exit from the work area. Excluding outdoor operations or work in buildings to be demolished, a ventilation system equipped with a HEPA filtered exhaust unit must be used to create and maintain a negative air pressure of 0.02 inches of water within the enclosed area relative to the area outside of the enclosure. The air pressure must be measured at regular intervals. The air intake must be taken from an area free from contamination of any hazardous dusts, vapours, smoke, fume, mist or gas. A competent person must inspect and maintain the ventilation system. The inspection is required before each use and damaged or defective parts replaced before the ventilation system is used. Before leaving the work area, workers must decontaminate using a HEPA vacuum or damp wiping. Facilities for the washing of hands and face shall be made available to workers and shall be used by every worker when leaving the work area. The following procedures apply to Type 3 operations carried on outdoors involving the following activities: The removal or disturbance of more than one square metre of friable asbestos-containing material during the repair, alteration, maintenance or demolition of all or part of a building, aircraft, ship, locomotive, railway car or vehicle or any machinery or equipment. The spray application of a sealant to friable asbestos-containing material. Cleaning or removing air handling equipment, including rigid ducting but not including filters, in a building that has sprayed fireproofing that is asbestos-containing material. Repairing, altering or demolishing all or part of a kiln, metallurgical furnace or similar structure that is made in part of refractory materials that are asbestos-containing materials. When performing work: ACM must be thoroughly wetted before and during removal unless it is hazardous to do so. Dust and waste shall not be permitted to fall freely from one work level to another. After the work area has been cleaned up using the HEPA vacuum or by damp mopping or wet sweeping, the work area must be washed down with water. Temporary electrical power for tools and equipment in wet removal operations shall be equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters. The decontamination facility shall be located as close as practicable to the work area and shall consist of a room suitable for changing into protective clothing and for storing contaminated protective clothing and equipment, a shower room as described by this regulation, and a room suitable for changing into street clothes and for storing clean clothing and equipment.

Repairing, altering or demolishing all or part of any building in which asbestos is or was used in the manufacture of products, unless the asbestos was cleaned up and removed before March 16, 1986. Be aware that: Friable asbestos-containing material that is lying on any surface shall be cleaned up and removed using a HEPA vacuum or by damp wiping. Everything shall be removed from the work area or covered with polyethylene sheeting or other suitable impervious material. A polyethylene enclosure or other suitable impervious material that is impervious to asbestos if the work area is not enclosed by walls. A decontamination facility is required and must consist of a series of interconnecting rooms including: a room for changing into and storing protective clothing a shower room as described by this regulation, a room for changing into and storing street clothes and equipment, and curtains of polyethylene sheeting or other suitable material that is impervious to asbestos, fitted to each side of the entrance or exit to each room. The decontamination rooms shall be arranged so that any person entering or exiting the facility must pass through each room. The mechanical ventilation system serving the work area shall be disabled and all openings or voids, including ventilation ducts to or from the work area, shall be sealed by tape or other appropriate means. For operations carried on indoors where the building will not be demolished, a ventilation system equipped with a HEPA filtered exhaust unit must be used to create and maintain a negative air pressure of 0.02 inches of water within the enclosed area relative to the area outside of the enclosure. The air pressure must be measured at regular intervals. The air intake must be taken from an area free from contamination of any hazardous dusts, vapours, smoke, fume, mist or gas. A competent person must inspect and maintain the ventilation system. The inspection is required before each use and damaged or defective parts replaced before the ventilation system is used. The shower room in the decontamination facility must have cold and hot water whose temperature isn ot less than 40° Celsius or more than 50° Celsius. Controls must be available to regulate water flow and temperature. The shower room must also be equipped with clean towels When leaving the work area, a worker shall enter the decontamination facility and shall, in the following order: decontaminate his or her protective clothing by using a vacuum equipped with a HEPA filter, or by damp wiping, before removing the protective clothing, if the protective clothing will not be reused, place it in an appropriate waste container, shower, and remove and clean the respirator. If practicable, existing electrical power distribution systems that are not water-tight shall be de-energized and locked out where wet removal operations are to be carried out. Temporary electrical power for tools and equipment in wet removal operations shall be equipped with ground fault circuit interrupters. Friable asbestos-containing material shall be thoroughly wetted before and during removal if safe to do so. A competent worker must inspect the enclosures, barriers and decontamination facility at the start and end of each shift and at least once each day on days where there are no shifts. If defects are found, no work shall be carried out and the defect must be repaired immediately. If practicable, dust and waste shall be kept wet. When work is complete, negative air pressure must be maintained. The walls of the enclosure must be washed or HEPA vacuumed. Equipment and tools must be cleaned by damp cloth or HEPA vacuum or discarded in an appropriate waste container. A visual inspection must be carried out by a competent person to ensure the enclosure and work area are free from visible dust or debris. Once dried and clean clearance air testing must be carried out by a competent person unless the operation is carried out in a building to be demolished. The barriers, enclosure and decontamination facility shall not be removed or dismantled until cleaning has been done in accordance with this regulation and the work area inside the enclosure has passed the clearance air testing if it is required. Sample collection for clearance air testing shall be performed using the phase contrast microscopy method or transmission electron microscopy. If the clearance air test fails, the work area, inner surfaces of the enclosures, equipment, and tools shall be cleaned again in accordance with this regulation. A visual inspection must be carried out by a competent worker. Clearance air testing using the phase contrast microscopy method shall be carried out in accordance with U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods, Method 7400, Issue 2: Asbestos and other Fibres by PCM (August 15, 1994), using the asbestos fibre counting rules, and shall comply with the following requirements: Testing shall be based on samples taken inside the enclosure. Before and during air sampling, fibres shall be dislodged inside the enclosure using forced air. At least 2,400 litres of air shall be drawn through each sample filter. The number of air samples to be collected shall be in accordance with Table 3 of this regulation. In order for the clearance air test to pass, every air sample has an airborne concentration that does not exceed 0.01 fibres per cubic centimeters of air. If the clearance air test fails using the phase contract microscopy method, the samples may be subjected to a second analysis using transmission electron microscopy in accordance with the standard mentioned in this regulation. When a second analysis is performed using transmission electron microscopy, the work area inside the enclosure passes the clearance air test only if every air sample collected has a concentration of asbestos fibres that does not exceed 0.01 fibres per cubic centimetre of air. Clearance air testing using the transmission electron microscopy method shall be carried out in accordance with U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Manual of Analytical Methods, Method 7402, Issue 2: Asbestos by TEM (August 15, 1994), and shall comply with the following requirements: Testing shall be based on samples taken inside the enclosure and samples taken outside the enclosure but inside the building. Before and during air sampling, fibres shall be dislodged inside the enclosure using forced air At least 2,400 litres of air shall be drawn through each sample filter. At least five air samples shall be taken inside each enclosure and at least five air samples shall be taken outside the enclosure but inside the building. Sampling inside and outside the enclosure shall be conducted concurrently. The work area inside the enclosure passes the clearance air test if the average concentration of asbestos fibres in the samples collected inside the enclosure is statistically less than the average concentration of asbestos fibres in the samples collected outside the enclosure, or if there is no statistical difference between the two average concentrations. Within 24 hours after the clearance air testing results are received, the owner and the employer shall post a copy of the results in a conspicuous place or places at the workplace, and if the building contains other workplaces, in a common area of the building. A copy shall be provided to the joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, if any, for the workplace and for the building. The owner of the building shall keep a copy of the clearance air testing results for at least one year after receiving them. Instruction and training The employer shall ensure that a competent person provides training and instruction to every worker in a Type 1, 2, or 3 Operation. The training must include: The hazards of asbestos exposure. Personal hygiene and work practices. The use, cleaning and disposal of respirators and protective clothing. The joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative, if any, for the workplace shall be advised of the time and place where the instruction and training are to be carried out. Instruction and training related to respirators shall include the limitations of the respirator, inspection and maintenance, proper fitting and cleaning and disinfection. Asbestos Abatement Training Programs The employer shall ensure that any worker involved in Type 3 operations has completed the Asbestos Abatement Worker Training Program approved by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities and that every supervisor in a Type 3 operation has successfully completed the Asbestos Abatement Supervisor Training Program approved by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. Documentation provided by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities is conclusive proof that a worker and supervisor have successfully completed the program. . As determined by a Director of the Ministry of Labour, a worker may complete equivalent training in another province or territory of Canada and hold a document showing successful completion of the MTCU training. . Asbestos work report The employer of a worker in a Type 2 or Type 3 operation must complete an asbestos work report at least once every 12-months and immediately upon the termination of the worker’s employment. The asbestos work report must be sent to the Ministry of Labour Provincial Physician and a copy given to the worker. Asbestos Workers Register The Ministry of Labour Provincial Physician shall establish and maintain an Asbestos Workers Register listing the name of each worker for whom an employer submits an asbestos work report. A worker on the asbestos workers register may volunteer to undergo prescribed medical examinations on the recommendation of the Provincial Physician. The worker may volunteer to undergo subsequent examinations if recommended by his/her physician. A medical examination includes medical questionnaire, chest x-rays and pulmonary function tests. Subsequent examinations of the same type if recommended by the worker’s physician will occur at least two years thereafter. If a worker is removed from exposure to asbestos because an examination discloses he/she may have or has a condition resulting from exposure to asbestos, the worker is entitled to compensation for loss of earnings provided by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997. Use of equivalent measure or procedures A constructor or employer may vary a measure or procedure that is required by Regulation 278 if it affords protection that is at least equal to the measures and procedures in the regulation. The constructor or employer must give written notice to the Joint Health and Safety Committee or Health and Safety Representative.

    "header": "Carbon Monoxide",
    "talk": "Carbon monoxide (chemical abbreviation: CO) is a clear, colourless gas you can’t smell or taste. It’s dangerous because it interferes with your body’s ability to use oxygen. Even in small doses, carbon monoxide can kill you. The first signs are headache and fatigue. Higher exposure can rapidly lead to loss of consciousness, arrested breathing, heart failure, and death. On a construction project you may be exposed to carbon monoxide when working around equipment and tools such as propane heaters, circular saws, compressors, scissor lifts, cement mixers, and any gasoline-, propane, or diesel-powered equipment. Exposure can be more severe when in an enclosed or confined space. In general, every employer must take all reasonable measures necessary to protect workers from exposure to hazardous biological or chemical agents, including carbon monoxide. Measures of protection include: engineering controls, work practices, hygiene facilities and practices, and personal protective equipment. Internal combustion engines in excavations, in buildings, or other enclosed structure must have an adequate supply of air for combustion (except for those operating in a tunnel). Exhaust gases and fumes must be discharged directly outside to a point far enough away to prevent the return of the gases or fumes. Similarly, the space must have adequate natural or mechanical ventilation to discharge exhaust and fumes so that carbon monoxide does not return or build up to hazardous levels. Internal combustion engines must be maintained in good condition so the engine’s exhaust discharge of carbon monoxide is minimized. Before using an internal combustion engine in a tunnel, a Ministry of Labour Director must give approval. Excavations, buildings, or enclosed structures where fuel is burnt must be to be tested for airborne concentrations of carbon monoxide to ensure the concentrations are not hazardous. Testing must be done according to a written testing strategy developed in consultation with a health and safety representative or the joint health and safety committee, if any. Exposure to concentrations may not exceed the time-weighted average limit (TWA)or the Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL). These limits are defined in Regulation 833 Control of Exposure to Biological or Chemical Agents, and can be found in the table entitled “Adopted Values” shown at pages 10 to 61 of the publication entitled 2013 Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices published by ACGIH and identified by International Standard Book Number 978-1-607260-59-2. Occupational Exposure Limits for Ontario Workplaces Agent [CAS No.] Time-Weighted Average Limit (TWA) Short-Term Exposure Limit (STEL) For any period of 30 minutes At any time Carbon monoxide [630-08-0] 25 parts per million (ppm) 75 ppm 125 ppm To determine if your workplace meets the allowable daily and weekly time-weighted average airborne concentrations of carbon monoxide, see Schedule 1 of Control of Exposure to Biological or Chemical Agents . When calculating these concentrations, any use of personal protective equipment, such as supplied air, does not alter the allowable limits of carbon monoxide to which a worker may be exposed."

    "talk": "Each year in Ontario, construction workers are injured while using chainsaws. Generally the injuries result from two types of accidents: the operator makes accidental contact with the revolving chain the operator is struck by the object being cut, usually a tree or heavy limb. Many of these injuries are serious or critical. While the chainsaw is relatively easy to operate, it can be lethal. As with all high-speed cutting tools, it demands the full attention of even the trained and experienced operator. Workers must be adequately trained before using chain-saws.   When using chain-saws workers must wear adequate personal protective equipment including protective clothing, gloves as well as eye and hearing protection.   Chainsaws must be firmly held by both hands when cutting. Chainsaws used in construction must have “anti-kickback” chains also referred to as “safety chains”.  They must also be equipped with a chain brake to prevent the chain from moving when the chainsaw is not in use.  Every gear, pulley, belt, chain, shaft, flywheel, saw and other mechanically-operated part of a machine to which a worker has access shall be guarded or fenced so that it will not endanger a worker."

    "subject": "confined_space",
    "header": "Confined Space",
    "talk": "A confined space is defined as a place: that is partially or fully enclosed that is not both designed and constructed for continuous human occupancy, and where atmospheric hazards may occur because of its construction, location, or contents, or because of work that is done in it. Physical hazards found in a confined space often present a greater danger inside an enclosed space than they do outside. Confined Space Program The confined space program can apply to one or more confined spaces. Program elements must include: a method of recognizing each confined space a method for assessing the hazards to which workers may be exposed a method for developing plans for controlling the hazards a method for training workers an entry permit system setting out measures and procedures to be followed when working in a confined space. Employers must provide a copy of the program to the constructor of a project. In turn, the constructor must provide a copy of the program to the project's joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative, if any. A copy must also be available to other employers to which the program relates and every worker if there is no project joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. Before allowing any worker to enter a confined space, employers must develop a written confined space program. The employer must maintain the program. Before allowing a worker to enter a confined space, the employer must develop and maintain a written confined space program that meets the requirements of the Confined Spaces Regulation. In the case of a workplace that is not a project, a confined space program must be developed and maintained in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative. Employers must provide a copy of the program to the constructor of a project. In turn, the constructor must provide a copy of the program to the project's joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative, if any. A copy must also be available to other employers to which the program relates, and to every worker if there is no project joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. If workers from more than one employer will be entering the confined space, the constructor must prepare a confined space coordination program. A copy of the confined space coordination document must be provided to each employer who is performing work in the confined space and to the project's joint health and safety committee or the health and safety representative. Coordination When workers of more than one employer perform work in the same confined space, the constructor must prepare a coordination document to ensure that the various employers perform their duties in a way that protects the health and safety of all workers. A copy of the coordination document must be provided to: each employer of workers who perform work in the same confined space the project's joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. If the workplace is not a project, the work detailed in the coordination document may assign this duty to one or more employers. Hazard Assessment Before each time that a worker enters a confined space, a person with adequate knowledge, training and experience must perform a written hazard assessment. The name of the competent worker must appear on the assessment, that person must give a copy to the employer, and the employer must keep a record of the competent worker's qualifications. The hazard assessment must take into account: the hazards that may exist in the confined space the hazards that may develop while work is performed inside the confined space general safety hazards in the confined space. An assessment is generally required for each confined space. But if there are two or more similar confined spaces containing the same hazards, then you need only a single assessment document but each confined space must be clearly identified and recorded. The record of an assessment may be incorporated into an entry permit under section 10. If requested, the employer must give copies of the assessment and the qualifications of the person with adequate knowledge, training and experience to the projectʼs joint health and safety committee, or the health and safety representative, or every worker involved in the confined space entry if the project has no joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative. The employer must review the assessment as often as necessary to make sure that the plans remain adequate. Plan Once the hazards have been identified in the assessment, a competent person must develop a plan to eliminate the hazards or control the risks. The primary objective of the plan is to eliminate the hazard before entry. If this is not possible, then controls, measures, and procedures must be put in place to ensure that workers are not in danger. If confined spaces are of similar construction and present the same hazards, a single plan can be used as long as the individual confined spaces are clearly identified in both the hazard assessment and the plan. The plan must contain provisions for: Duties of workers Co-ordination document (prepared by the constructor) if workers of more than one contractor enter the same confined space On-site rescue procedures Rescue equipment and methods of communication Protective clothing and equipment Isolation of energy and control of material movement Attendants Adequate means of entry and exit (access and egress) Atmospheric testing (conducted by a competent worker) Adequate procedures for working in the presence of explosive or flammable substances Ventilation and purging Worker Training Workers entering a confined space must be trained by a competent person before they enter a confined space. The training must be developed in consultation with the joint health and safety committee or worker representative, and include: recognizing the hazards and potential hazards in the confined space, safe work practices, and the importance of following the confined space entry plan. General hazard identification training and plan specific training may be combined. You must review the content of the training at least annually, and whenever there is a change in circumstances such as a change in an industrial process. If the review indicates that the training is not adequate, you must provide additional training. You must keep a record of the names of trainers, trainees, as well as the date of training. If the project’s joint health and safety committee or health and safety representative wants a copy of the record, you must provide one. Entry Permits Employers must issue a separate entry permit each time work is to be performed in a confined space before any worker enters the confined space. Before each shift, a competent person must verify that the permit issued complies with the plan. Entry permits must be understood by everyone involved in the job and must be readily available to every person entering the confined space. Entry permits must include the location and description of the confined space a description of the work a description of the hazards and the corresponding controls the time period for which the entry permit applies the name of the attendant a record of each worker who enters and leaves a list of the equipment required for entry and rescue, and verification that the equipment is in good working order the results of the atmospheric testing additional procedures and control measures if hot work is to be done. On-site rescue procedures Adequate written on-site rescue procedures for each confined space must be developed and ready for immediate implementation. Before workers enter a confined space, employers must provide the necessary number of competent rescue personnel. Rescue personnel persons must be trained in: on-site rescue procedures first aid and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation; and the use of the rescue equipment required by a relevant plan. Employers are responsible for making sure that identified rescue equipment must be: readily available, appropriate for entry into the confined space, inspected as often as is necessary, by a competent person designated by the employer, and a written record of these inspections must be kept by the employer or constructor. The employer must have methods of communication in place that are appropriate for the hazards identified in the assessment, and make these communication methods available to the workers and the attendant. Personal protective equipment, clothing and devices Employers must ensure workers in a confined space are provided with the necessary personal protective equipment, clothing and devices according to a relevant plan. Isolation of Energy and Control of Material Movement The following sources of energy must be controlled by taking the steps outlined, or if this method(s) is not practical, other satisfactory means may be used according to a relevant plan: Blanking or disconnecting piping can be used to protect against the release of hazardous substances. Electrical equipment in the confined space should be disconnected, tagged, locked out, and grounded when possible. Isolating equipment that moves in any way. This isolation can be achieved by disconnecting the equipment from its power source and de-energizing the equipment, or lockout and tagging, blocking or other means. Employers must also use measures to protect workers from drowning, engulfment, entrapment, suffocation and other hazards from free-flowing material. Attendants An attendant must be present whenever a worker enters a confined space. The attendant is not allowed to enter the confined space, unless he or she is replaced by another attendant according to the plan. The attendant must: be assigned, remain outside and near to the entrance (or the entrance that will best allow the attendant to perform their duties), be in constant communication (visual or speech) with all workers in the confined space, be provided with a device for summoning adequate rescue response in case of emergency, monitor the safety of workers inside the confined space, provide assistance as necessary, and summon adequate rescue procedure if required. The attendant is not allowed to enter the confined space to perform a rescue even after help has arrived unless he or she is replaced by another attendant in accordance with the plan. Entry and Exit (Access and Egress) Confined space entrances and exits must be provided to all workers and according with relevant plan. Entrances and exits must be secured so that only authorized workers can enter. There must be adequate barricades and warning signs. Atmospheric testing The employer must appoint a competent person to safely test the atmosphere in the confined space before and during the time a worker is there to ensure that acceptable atmospheric levels are maintained according to the relevant plan. If the confined space has been left unoccupied and unattended, you must perform the testing again. Testing instruments must be properly calibrated, maintained and be appropriate for the hazards in each specific confined space. Results of every sample of a test must be recorded on the entry permit. If continuous monitoring is performed, test results must be recorded at adequate intervals. Explosive and flammable substances The employer must make sure that elimination of hazards or control of risks from explosive and flammable substances is achieved by ventilation, purging or other means, according to the relevant plan. The employer must make sure that no worker enters or remains in a confined space that contains, or is likely to contain, an airborne combustible dust or mist whose atmospheric concentration may create a hazard of explosion. Generally, when there is an accumulation of flammable, combustible or explosive agents in a confined space, entry is allowed only if: the hazardous atmosphere is rendered inert by adding an inert gas and it can be continuously monitored to ensure it remains inert the workers use adequate respiratory protective equipment adequate rescue equipment is provided so that the person outside can locate and rescue the worker other equipment is provided as is necessary to ensure the worker’s safety. The following are the legislated exceptions: The inspection will not create a source of ignition. Atmospheric concentration of an explosive or flammable gas or vapour is less than 25% of its lower explosive limit (LEL), as determined by a combustible gas instrument. If cold work is being done, the concentration of flammable gas or vapour must be less than 10% of its LEL. If hot work is being done and all the following conditions are in place: the concentration of flammable or explosive gas less than 5% of its LEL, the oxygen content will likely remain less than 23%, the atmosphere is monitored continuously, an entry permit provides for control measures for hot work, and corresponding control measures, an adequate warning system and exit procedure are in place if explosive or flammable gas or vapour exceeds 5% of its LEL or oxygen content of the atmosphere exceeds 23 per cent by volume. Ventilation and purging Ventilation, purging or both may be required to ensure safe atmospheric conditions. If mechanical ventilation is used , an adequate warning system and exit procedure is required. If mechanical ventilation or purging is not practical: the workers must use adequate respiratory protective equipment adequate rescue equipment must be provided so that the person outside can locate and rescue the worker other equipment must be provided as is necessary to ensure the worker’s safety Recordkeeping The constructor for the project, and the employer for the workplace or project, as the case may be, must keep records of every: plan assessment coordination document training entry permit record of rescue equipment inspection record of tests All the above records must be kept for at least one year after the project is finished, or a period that is necessary to maintain at least the two of the most recent records of each kind concerning each particular confined space, whichever time period is longer. The records must be available for inspection. Records must be kept by those responsible for creating them. On a project, they may be kept by either the employer or the constructor."

    "subject": "demolition",
    "header": "Demolition and Damaged Structures",
    "talk": "Demolition is the act of tearing down existing buildings and structures. It can be as simple as removing a portion of a house for a renovation project or as complex as demolishing a multi-storey building. Over the years, demolition work has evolved from a mainly manual process to a heavily mechanical one. Some tasks still have to be done manually and now the majority of loss time injuries in demolition are from musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). Simple and practical work methods to reduce the risk of overexertion have helped to lower the injury rates in this sector. However workers are still exposed to a variety of other occupational hazards including falling structures and materials, dust, asbestos, lead, hazardous noise levels, and potential of falls from heights. Owners must determine if there is any asbestos that may be handled, disturbed or removed during the demolition or dismantling process. Please see Designated Substance -- Asbestos on Construction Projects and in Buildings and Repair Operations, O. Reg 278/05 to get a full description of the legal duties concerning working safely near asbestos. Owners must supply the demolition contractors with a designated substance report as well. The Occupational Health and Safety Act states that: Duty of project owners 30. (1) Before beginning a project, the owner shall determine whether any designated substances are present at the project site and shall prepare a list of all designated substances that are present at the site. It is a good idea to not only provide a list but to locate to the demolition contractor where the designated substances are located. Remember there may also be local by-laws regulating demolition projects as well as other provincial regulations such as environmental rules that must be followed. When a structure is so damaged that it becomes and hazard and endangers workers because of the potential for a partial or complete collapse, it must be braced and shored. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to prevent injuries of those near damaged structures or the demolition site. Progressively install safeguards from the safest areas towards the damaged structure, so that workers establishing the safeguards are not endangered. Only workers who are working on the demolition, dismantling or moving of a structure can be in, on or near that structure. There must be barriers to prevent people from coming near or inside the remaining parts of a structure when the demotion or dismantling is stopped. Workers can only enter such a structure if it can support the worker and will not collapse. Before demolition, dismantling or moving of a structure, appropriate safeguards must be in place so that people on or near the demolition site are not injured, all gas, electrical and other services must be shut off or disconnected and remain so if they could endanger workers and other people, and toxic, flammable or explosive substances must be removed. Demolishing and dismantling of a building or structure The listed rules below do NOT apply when any of the following are being used in the demolition process, a heavy weight suspended by cable from a crane or similar hoisting device, a power shovel, bulldozer or other vehicle, and the use of explosives. When using a mechanical device, it must be operated from a point as far as is practical from the building or structure being demolished. When a swinging weight, like a wrecking ball, is being used, the weight’s supporting cable must be as short as possible or restrained so it will not touch other buildings orstructures. Demolition and dismantling will begin at the highest point of a structure and work towards to the lowest point, unless this procedure would be dangerous to workers. When leaving the skeleton structural frame in place, masonry and loose material must be removed systematically and continuously from the highest to the lowest points. Any work above a tier or floor must be completed before the tier supports or floor are affected by the work of demolition or dismantling. Before demolition, all glass on an outside wall, such as windows and doors must be removed or protected to prevent the glass from breaking during demolition. Mechanical demolition is often used so that glass can be demolished during the process, not before. Masonry walls must be removed in reasonably level courses. When working on a masonry wall, do not loosen or allow material to fall when they could endanger a person or the structural stability of a scaffold, a floor, or other support of the building or structure. When removing material, while standing on top of a wall, pier or chimney, there must be flooring, scaffolding or staging provided on all sides of it that is not more than 2.4 metres below the place where the worker is working. Before a truss, girder or other structural piece is disconnected, it must be relieved of all loads, other than its own weight, and have temporary support. Basements, cellars or any excavated area left, after the structure above is removed, must have fencing along all the open sides or be backfilled to grade level. If the basement or cellar has a roof, floor or solid covering with fastened planks to cover open areas, fencing or backfilling is not necessary. Housekeeping Waste from a demolition project must be taken to a disposal area and reusable material to a storage area at least once a day and as often as is necessary to keep the site safe for workers and others. Please note that Ontario has a waste sorting and recycling regime covered in Ontario Regulations 102/94 and 103/92. Garbage and recyclable materials must be lowered by chute into containers. Alternatively, these materials can be lowered by crane or hoist. Any materials falling freely during the demolition or dismantling must fall into designated enclosed areas. People must not have access to these designated areas. Chutes must: be adequate for their jobs and rigidly secured; be enclosed on four sides when its slope is more than a gradient of one in one; have a gate at the bottom if it is necessary to control the flow of material. The entrance to a chute: cannot allow any material to spill when materials are being deposited into a chute, if it is at or below floor level, it must have a curb that is at least 100 millimetres high, cannot be more than 1.2 metres high, must be closed when not being used, and must be designed so that people cannot or are discouraged from entering the chute. At the end of every chute there be must a container or an enclosed, barrier, or fenced-in area."

    "subject": "electrical_hazards_flash",
    "header": "Electrical Hazards - Flash Hazards",
    "talk": "An “arc flash hazard” is defined by the CSA Z462-15 Workplace Electrical Safety as a “dangerous condition associated with the release of energy caused by an electric arc”. An arc flash is a dangerous condition which involves an explosion, and can result in serious injuries, burns, and damage to the lungs, eardrums, and eyes. Arc flashes may also cause death. These conditions can lead to arc flash: accidental contact between two conductors wiring errors insulation deterioration or failure corrosion of equipment contamination of the equipment (e.g., dust, moisture) animals, tools, or fallen parts that short-circuit the equipment poor/lack of maintenance workers using improper or non-rated tools equipment failures, overload, improper use, human error. An electrical hazard is considered to be removed when protective measures/controls are put in place at the source (e.g., remove the hazard or de-energize), or along the path (e.g., place electrical insulation or a barrier between the worker and the electrical hazard). Where PPE only is needed for worker protection, an electrical hazard is considered to remain and it is necessary to address safety requirements for other workers in the area. Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed according to the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. The above electrical work is performed under the authority of the electrical utility and the electrical work is performed by authorized workers (workers are given formal permission from the owner and employer and they are competent to perform work on and in proximity to electrical transmission and distribution systems). Examples are powerline technicians that are performing approved work methods to install and maintain electrical transmission and distribution systems. Electrical work outside of the above scope must be performed according to the following requirements. Electrical tools and equipment must meet industry standards. Examples may include, but not limited to, voltage rated tools, correct categories of diagnostic equipment, multi-meters, proximity testers, amp meters and other diagnostic equipment as required, non-conductive ladders, non-conductive scaffolding, voltage rated gloves, and appropriate arc flash protective equipment and clothing. Workers must be trained in and familiar with the tools, equipment and protective devices including personal protective equipment as defined from regulations and/or standards. Workers must follow documented safe work procedures and practices to make sure that they are protected from electrical hazards associated with the work. Only the authorized person (authorized by the supervisor in charge of the project) may enter a room or other enclosure that contains exposed energized electrical parts. The entrance to this room or enclosure must be marked with warning signs stating that unauthorized people may not enter. Electrical hazards must be identified, workers shall be protected from the electrical hazards to what they are exposed. All tools, devices and equipment, including personal protective equipment, that are used for working on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installations or conductors must be designed, tested, maintained, and used in ways that provide protection to workers. When working on or near exposed energized machinery and other apparatus, arc flash, flame resistant clothing and other personal protective equipment (PPE) must provide an adequate level of protection to protect the worker the outer layer of clothing must be made of arc flash, flame resistant material other clothing worn with arc flash, flame resistant PPE must not contribute to increased worker injury PPE used must be manufactured, tested and maintained to current recognized industry standards workers shall wear approved eye protection in all circumstances where there is a possibility of an electrical flash or arc. From the Electrical Utility Safety Rules , s. 113. Electrical arc flash hazards must be identified. Workers that are exposed to arc flash hazards must be adequately protected from the arc flash hazards. This protection is most commonly achieved through an arc flash hazard risk assessment or the application of task tables from the electrical standards. The risk assessment would include the assessment of the equipment or devices to determine the potential incident energy that may be produced in the case of an electrical incident. Arc flash risk assessments also help establish safe work procedures for the electrical workers when performing electrical tasks. The risk assessments allow the worker to determine the safe approach boundaries for contact and arc flash hazards. Workers who may be exposed to electrical shocks or burns from flash hazards must be trained to use and wear voltage rated rubber gloves and leather protectors as necessary. Rubber gloves must be worn with adequate leather protectors and cannot be worn inside out. Leather protectors must be visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Inadequate or damaged gloves or protectors should not be used. Workers must be trained in the proper use, care, and storage of rubber gloves and leather protectors. Voltage rated rubber gloves shall be used and maintained according to the manufactures recommendations and industry standards as prescribed. Rubber gloves with leather protectors, arc flash protective clothing and equipment, voltage rated tools and defined shock hazard boundaries are the most common protective equipment and measures used for shock protection. All protective rubber gloves must: protect the worker against electrical shock and burn, and be air tested and visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Rubber gloves rated for voltages above 5,000 volts AC must be tested and certified that they can withstand the voltages for which they are rated: at least once every three months, if they are in service, and at least once every six months, if they are not in service. NOTE: Voltage rated gloves must meet approved industry standards. They shall be maintained on intervals as prescribed by the manufacture or industry standards, in addition to the requirements from provincial regulations. Specific care and maintenance standards can be found within CSA Z462-15 Workplace Electrical Safety or CAN/UL S 801 Electric Utility Workplace Electrical Safety for Generation, Transmission, and Distribution."

    "talk": "Lockout is a procedure that prevents the release of hazardous energy. It often involves workers using a locking device to keep a switch in the “off” position, or to isolate the energy of moving parts. This procedure prevents electric shock, sudden movement of components, chemical combustion, falling counterweights, and other actions that can endanger lives. Lockout is a physical way to ensure that the energy source is de-energized, deactivated, or otherwise inoperable. Tagging tells others that the device is locked out, who has locked it out, and why. Tagged devices and systems must not be re-energized without the authority of those named on the tag. There are four documents in this series. Please also see flash hazards , working on energized systems , and operating equipment near energized systems . Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed in accordance with the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. All electrical hazards must be identified. Electrical hazards then must be removed as to not create a hazard to workers. If electrical hazards cannot be removed, workers must be adequately protected from the electrical hazards. Workers must follow written procedures and apply measures to ensure that workers do not become injured from the electrical hazards. Before work is done near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment or an electrical installation or conductor workplaces must: : have written procedures that adequately protect workers from electrical shock and burn have copies of the procedures available to every worker on the project ensure workers follow the written procedures Hazardous stored electrical energy must be adequately discharged or contained before the work begins, and kept this way while the work continues. Workers must verify that the power supply and the hazardous stored energy have been disconnected, discharged or contained and will remain so as the work continues. Test before touch, and follow safe work procedures to ensure electrical energy has been discharged though the lock out tag out procedures. When using tags, the tag must: be made of non-conducting material be installed in a way that it cannot become energized be placed in a highly visible location be secured to prevent its inadvertent removal not be removed until the machinery or system is unlocked Each tag must indicate: the reason why the equipment, installation or conductor is disconnected the name of the person who disconnected the equipment, installation or conductor the name of employer, and the date and time of the lockout. When there are multiple workers using machinery or energized systems, workers must have a way to communicate the status of the hazardous stored electrical energy and electrical equipment, installation or conductor. There are times when disconnecting conductors, installations or equipment is not practical or possible. See the document Electrical Hazards – Working on energized systems for more information."

    "talk": "Overhead powerlines are frequently hit by construction equipment such as dump trucks and cranes; however, elevating work platforms and other equipment such as ladders and rolling scaffolds are also involved. Many powerline contacts involve low-voltage service and buried cable. Electrical shock is the passing of electric current through the body. Electrical current can cause ventricular defilation, cardiac arrest, involuntary physical movements, including preventing you from releasing your grip from a live conductor, throw you into contact with a higher voltage conductor, cause you to lose your balance and fall, cause severe internal and external burns, and can kill you. There are four documents in this series. Please also see flash hazards , working on energized systems , and lockout and tagging . Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed in accordance with the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. Sections 182, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191 and 193 do not apply to electrical work that is performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems if the work is performed in accordance with the document referred to above. Electrical work performed on a construction project must be performed by an electrician as prescribed in the provincial regulations. Electrical hazards must be identified on the construction projects and only competent persons shall be permitted to perform work on or near electrical systems or apparatus. Every reasonable precaution shall be taken to ensure workers are protected from electrical hazards. This action includes the locking/tagging out of electrical equipment, identifying powerlines and electrical systems that both part of the construction activities and not part of construction activities. Examples include power lines overhead and underground, high and low voltage services, and distribution/transmission systems.Communicating with neighbouring electrical system owners to ensure the construction activities do not encroach or interfere with local distribution/transmission or services to neighbouring properties may also be necessary. Written safe work procedures must be in place to ensure all workers are protected from electrical hazards depending on the scope, impact and potential and actual hazards to the workers. The written safe work procedures must be communicated to all workers and when necessary to neighbouring electrical systems to ensure workers are protected from the electrical hazards. Tools, ladders, scaffolding and other equipment or material that is able to conduct electricity must not be stored or used so close to energized electrical equipment, installations or conductors that they can make electrical contact. When work is to be done on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installation or conductor, the employer must: Establish and implement written measures and procedures that comply with the law, and ensure workers are protected from electrical shock and burn, and Make a copy of the written measures and procedures available to every worker on the project. The worker must follow the written measures and procedures. When objects could be near live overhead powerlines, minimum safe distances are required: Normal phase-to-phase voltage rating Minimum distance 750 or more volts, but no more than 150,000 volts 3 metres More than 150,000 volts, but no more than 250,000 volts 4.5 metres More than 250,000 volts 6 metres Written measures and procedures include the following: Place adequate warning devices in the area of the electrical hazard so at least one is always visible to the operator. Provide a sign that meets specified requirements, for example, “Danger! Electrical powerlines overhead.” Make sure the operator has been provided with written notification of the electrical hazard before beginning the work. Make sure there is a sign warning of the hazard that is visible to the operator at the operator’s station. Before a worker starts work, make sure that the employer provides and explains the procedures to the worker. A competent worker must be designated as a signaller to warn the operator when any part of the equipment, load, or hoist line may approach the minimum distance. The signaller must be in full view of the operator and have a clear view of the equipment and the conductor. An exemption to these measures is only allowed if, under the authority of the owner of the electrical conductor, protective devices and equipment are installed, and written procedures are implemented that are adequate to protect the workers from electrical shock and burn. Workers involved must use protective devices and equipment, and follow written measures and procedures."

    "talk": "Electrical work performed on or near electrical transmission or distribution systems must be performed in accordance with the “Electrical Utility Safety Rules ” published by the Infrastructure Health and Safety Association. Workplaces are required to take every reasonable precaution to prevent hazards from energized electrical equipment, installations and conductors. The above electrical work is performed under the authority of the electrical utility and the electrical work is performed by authorized workers, workers are given formal permission from the owner and employer and they are competent to perform work on and in proximity to electrical transmission and distribution systems. Examples are powerline technicians that are performing approved work methods to install and maintain electrical transmission and distribution systems. Electrical work outside of the above scope must be performed according to the following requirements. Where work must be done on, or near enough to the hazard, to make electrical contact or near enough to be exposed to injury from an arc flash, work while the system is energized is permitted only if specific conditions are met. Testing/Diagnostic testing with a meter/testing device is considered to be working on energized equipment, and requires appropriate protection including electrical contact and arc flash personal protective equipment. Written safe work procedures are also required. Electrical hazards must be identified, workers shall be protected from the electrical hazards to what they are exposed. No worker can connect, maintain, or modify electrical equipment or installations unless they hold the appropriate certificate of qualification, or are otherwise allowed. Workers who do not hold these qualifications are allowed to attach a cord of an electrical equipment or tool and remove it from a receptacle. Only the authorized person (authorized by the supervisor in charge of the project) may enter a room or other enclosure that contains exposed energized electrical parts. The entrance to this room or enclosure must be marked with warning signs stating that unauthorized people may not enter. Electrical equipment, installations, conductors, and insulating materials must be suitable for their intended use, and be installed, maintained, modified, and operated in a way that is not a hazard to a worker. Electrical equipment, installations and conductors that are not used for the purpose they were designed for must be removed, left in an electrically non-hazardous condition by being disconnected, de-energized, tagged, and either grounded if a power line or locked out if it is electrical equipment. Electrical tools and equipment must meet industry standards examples may include but not limited to voltage rated tools, correct categories of diagnostic equipment, multi-meters, proximity testers, amp meters and other diagnostic equipment as required, non-conductive ladders, non-conductive scaffolding, voltage rated gloves, appropriate arc flash protective equipment and clothing. Workers shall be trained in and familiar with the tools, equipment and protective devices including personal protective equipment as defined from regulations. Workers shall follow documented safe work procedures and practices to ensure that they are protected from electrical hazards associated with the work. Tools, ladders, scaffolding and other equipment or material that is able to conduct electricity must not be stored or used so close to energized electrical equipment, installations or conductors that they can make electrical contact. When work is to be done on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installation or conductor, the employer must: Establish and implement written measures and procedures that comply with the law, and ensure workers are protected from electrical shock and burn, and Make a copy of the written measures and procedures available to every worker on the project. The worker must follow the written measures and procedures. The power supply to the electrical equipment, installation or conductor must be disconnected, locked out of service, and tagged before the work begins. It must also be kept in this state while the work continues. Hazardous stored energy must be adequately discharged or contained before the work begins, and kept in that state while the work continues. Workers must verify that these conditions are met before beginning work. Work on energized equipment is permitted only if: it is not reasonably possible to disconnect the equipment, installation, or conductor from the power supply, the equipment is rated at a nominal voltage of 600 volts or less, and disconnecting the equipment would create a greater hazard to workers than proceeding without disconnecting it, or the work consists only of diagnostic testing. All tools, devices and equipment, including personal protective equipment must be designed, tested, maintained so that they provide adequate protection to workers when they are working on or near energized exposed parts of electrical equipment, installations or conductors. Defective electrical equipment and tools that may be a hazard must be immediately disconnected, removed from service, and tagged as being defective. Any case of a ground fault or the tripping of a ground fault circuit interrupter must be immediately investigated to determine the hazard. Corrective action must be taken immediately. Unless the work consists only of diagnostic testing or involves a nominal voltage under 300 volts, an adequately equipped competent worker who can perform rescue operations, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), must be stationed where he or she can see the workers performing the live work. Work on energized equipment nominally rated greater than 400 amperes and greater than 200 volts, or greater than 200 amperes and greater than 300 volts, can only be done if: the owner of the equipment provides the employer and the constructor with a record showing that it has been maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications a copy of the maintenance record is readily available at the project the employer has determined from the maintenance record that work on the equipment can be performed safely without disconnecting it before beginning live work, the worker has verified that requirements have been met workers must use mats, shields or other protective devices or equipment, including personal protective equipment, adequate to protect the worker from electrical shock and burn Workers who may be exposed to electrical shocks or burns from flash hazards must be trained to use and wear rubber gloves and leather protectors when necessary. Rubber gloves must be worn with adequate leather protectors and cannot be worn inside out. Leather protectors and rubber gloves must be visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Inadequate or damaged gloves or protectors should not be used. Voltage rated rubber gloves shall be used and maintained as per the manufactures recommendations and industry standards. Rubber gloves, leather protectors and defined shock hazard boundaries are the most common protective measures and equipment used for shock protection. All protective rubber gloves must: protect the worker against electrical shock and burn, and be air tested and visually inspected for damage and adequacy immediately before each use. Rubber gloves rated for voltages above 5,000 volts ACmust be tested and certified that they can withstand the voltages for which they are rated. Voltage rated gloves also must meet approved industry standards, they shall be maintained on intervals as prescribe by the manufacture or industry standards if additional requirements from provincial regulations. Voltage rated gloves also must be tested in accordance with manufacture and industry approved testing procedures as prescribe from the manufactures. at least once every three months, if they are in service, and at least once every six months, if they are not in service."

    "talk": "Operation of an elevating work platform may become dangerous if it is not used, maintained or stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Common hazards associated with platform use can be caused by overriding safety features, working near powerlines, overloading the platform, poor maintenance, unauthorized modifications, misuse of the equipment, soft or sloped ground conditions, improper loading, and improper set up of equipment. Hazards can include crushing, tipping, ejection, electrocution, and contact from passing vehicular equipment. All elevating work platforms must be designed and certified by a professional engineer, as being in compliance with the following CSA standard. CAN3-B354.1-M82, “Elevating Rolling Work Platform” CAN3-B354.2-M82,and CAN3-B354.3-M82 “Self-Propelled Elevating Work Platform” CAN3-B354.4-M82, “Boom-Type Elevating Work Platforms” CAN-CSA-C225-10, “Vehicle-Mounted Aerial Device” The owner of an elevating work platform must follow the manufacturer’s instructions to maintain it, such that the safety factors of the original design are maintained. Signs must be posted on the elevating platform, in clear view of the operator, which denote: the rated working load all limiting operating conditions including the use of outriggers, stabilizers and extendable axles specific firm level surface conditions necessary for safe use of the platform in the elevated position all manufacture’s warnings direction of machine movement for each operating control, unless a boom-type platform the applicable CSA standards the name and address of the owner any additional decals identified by the manufacturer Elevating work platforms must be inspected by a trained worker each day before being used. Near the operator’s station, a maintenance and inspection record tag must be attached which indicates the date of the last maintenance and inspection, the name and signature of the person who performed the work, and that the maintenance was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The instruction manual must also be available on each platform and kept in good condition. Owners or suppliers must keep a log of all inspections, tests, repairs, modifications, and maintenance. The log must be kept up to date and include names and signatures of persons who performed inspections and other work. An elevating work platform must: not be loaded in excess of its rated working load be used and moved only according to the manufacturer’s written instructions not be loaded and used in a way that affects its stability or endanger a worker not be moved unless all workers on it are protected from ejection by being attached to an adequate fixed support on the elevating work platform by a method of fall protection. (This provision does not apply to a mast climbing work platform or a mast climbing transport platform if the platform has guardrails protecting all open sides of the platform where a worker is exposed to a hazard of falling 2.4 metres or more) An elevating work platform that is a boom type or a vehicle-mounted aerial device shall not be used unless all workers on it are protected from falling by being attached to an adequate fixed support on the elevating work platform by a method of fall protection.

    "header": "Emergency Procedures and Rescue of Workers",
    "talk": "In order for everyone to be prepared for emergencies, every project needs an emergency response plan before work begins. An emergency is any situation that has the potential to harm the life, health, or safety of a person, public property, or the environment. The purpose of an emergency response plan is to make sure that emergency procedures are in place and every worker is prepared to respond to any emergency in a correct, timely, consistent, and dependable manner. Emergency procedures at the project Constructors are responsible for ensuring that each project has written emergency procedures and that these procedures are followed. All emergency procedures must be reviewed with any joint health and safety committees or the health and safety representatives, if present. Emergency procedures must be posted in main area where it can be seen by workers at the project. Every worker must have ready access to a telephone, two-way radio or other system of two-way communication in the event of an emergency. Rescue of Workers Underground Before work at a project begins employers must have emergency procedures for rescuing underground workers. Post copies signed by the employer and supervisors of underground workers around the project. Practice all these procedures and follow them in an emergency. At least four workers at a project must have underground rescue training by a competent person appointed by a Director. If there are fewer than four workers at the project, all the workers must be trained. Employers must supply rescue workers with appropriate and necessary rescue equipment and the workers must be readily available if an emergency arises. Rescue workers must have completed training within 30 days before work on tunnels begin and be retrained at least every thirty days. Before a project begins, the supervisor must designate a rescue worker to inspect and test all rescue equipment every thirty days. Self- Contained Breathing Apparatus If a tunnel and shaft’s combined length is more than 45 metres, every rescue worker must be given a self-contained breathing apparatus with a full facemask. A competent person must train rescue workers in the proper operation of the self-contained breathing apparatus. Training must be repeated every thirty days. If the underground space is less than 100 metres, the self-contained breathing apparatus must have a minimum rating for 30 minutes of use. If the underground space is between 100 – 150 metres, it must have a minimum rating for 60 minutes of use. For spaces longer than 150 m, it must be rated for at least 90 minutes of use. Every self-contained breathing apparatus that is designated for emergency rescues must be the same model by the same manufacturer. Keep the self-contained breathing apparatuses readily available and near an access point to underground work area. A sufficient number of self-contained breathing apparatuses must be available on the project at any given time (with four as a minimum) for all rescue work. A competent person must inspect every self-contained breathing apparatus at least once a month, or more often if required by the manufacturer. Self Rescue Respirator Workers who may enter a tunnel or shaft must be given their own self-rescue respirator which provides protection against hazardous gases. They must be trained to use, care and maintain the respirator as well as its limitations per the manufacturer’s specifications. Workers must keep their respirators nearby while working in a tunnel or shaft. Emergency Rescue of Workers from a Suspended Work Platform, Boatswain’s Chair or in a Hoisting Operation Before working on a boatswain’s chair and suspended work platform for the first time, workers must be trained in elements of emergency rescue procedures and workers must be able to competently use the emergency controls. Employers are ultimately responsible for ensuring a competent prepares written emergency rescue procedures for suspended work platforms and boatswain’s chairs. The site-specific work plan must include a copy of these procedures. Workers on these suspended platforms and boatswain chairs must be able to alert rescue workers in an emergency situation. Written emergency rescue procedures are also required in any hoisting operation and these procedures must be communicated to all workers. Construction Projects regulation also requires that before workers use any fall arrest system or safety net on a project, the employer must develop written rescue procedures."
